## From Wenbin
1. Development data mining.
2. Diversity RNA-Seq only collect seedling of different lines, and use the NAM RNA-Seq Pat collected
3. you can also do a public RNA-Seq pan-genome analysis only using seedling from different lines, or different tissues 


## From Jinliang
1. count RNA-seq reads using [kallisto](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/) for three diversity populations (http://zeabigdata.org/2016/11/RNA-seq-diversity/). 
2. eQTL/GWAS/epistasis studies across multiple tissues with above data.
3. Phenotypic GWAS for the above diversity panels.
4. Incorporating expression data for GWAS.
