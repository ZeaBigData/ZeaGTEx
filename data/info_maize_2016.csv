Chromosomal regions that have acquired cenH3 either by expansion of the cenH3 domain or its relocation by up to four Mb from the original centromere location, are colonized by the centromere-specific retrotransposon CR2 at a rate that would result in centromere-sized (1.8 Mb) CR2 clusters in 20,000-90,000 years.",NA

Thus, D. oligosanthes is ideally placed to serve as an in-group for panicoid comparative genomics. Here we report the assembly of the nuclear and chloroplast genomes of D. oligosanthes, from high-throughput short read sequencing data, as well as a comparative transcriptomics analysis of the developing leaf of D. oligosanthes, S. bicolor, and S. viridis. Physiological and anatomical characterizations verified that D. oligosanthes utilizes the C3 pathway for carbon fixation and lacks Kranz anatomy. Expression profiles of transcription factors (TFs) along developing leaves of D. oligosanthes, S. bicolor, and S. viridis were compared with previously published data from, Zea mays and Oryza sativa to identify a small suite of TFs that likely acquired functions specifically related to C4 photosynthesis.",NA
"SRA435425","2016-06-28","GEO",257,"2016",NA,NA,"Barley transcriptional responses to specialist and generalist spider mite herbivores","Spider mites, including the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae, TSSM) and the Banks grass mite (Oligonychus pratensis, BGM), are becoming increasingly important agricultural pests. The TSSM is an extreme generalist documented to feed on more than 1100 plant hosts. In contrast, the BGM is a grass specialist, with hosts including important cereal crops like maize, wheat, sorghum and barley. Historically, studies of plant-herbivore interactions have focused largely on insects. However, far less is known about plant responses to spider mite herbivores, especially in grasses, and whether responses differ between generalists and specialists. To identify plant defense pathways responding to spider mites, we collected time course RNA-seq data from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) infested with TSSMs and BGMs. Additionally, and as a comparison to the physical damage caused by spider mite feeding, a wounding treatment was also included. Overall design: The experiment was performed with four biological replicates across each of the following (28 samples in total): no infestation (C, control), 2hr after wounding (W2), 24hr after wounding (W24), 2hr after TSSM infestation (T2), 24hr after TSSM infestation (T24), 2hr after BGM infestation (B2), and 24hr after BGM infestation (B24).",NA

ZmCCA1b is characterized as a central clock regulator gene with evolutionarily conserved molecular and circadian functions and nonadditively expressed in F1 hybrid seedlings. ZmCCA1b binds to over 4,300 target genes in the maize genomes, of which annotation confirms energy metabolic pathways as the main output. We report that an altered temporal binding activity of ZmCCA1b in the hybrid seedlings, which increases expression of carbon fixation genes, increases carbon fixation rates and biomass, demonstrating a novel example of how circadian-regulatory networks directly contribute to growth vigor in maize hybrids. These results collectively offer new insights into clock-mediated regulation of growth vigor in hybrid plants and crops. Overall design: Profiling genome-wide binding events of ZmCCA1b in the maize inbreds and F1 hybrids at ZT3, ZT9 and ZT15 using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). 2 biological replicates for each sample were used.

Epigenetic mechanisms - DNA methylation, chromatin modifications and non coding RNAs - were shown to play a fundamental role in stress-induced gene regulation and may also result in genome destabilization, with the activation and/or the transcription of silenced transposons and retroelements, causing genome rearrangements and novel gene expression patterns.  Maize leaf transcriptome was analyzed by total RNA-Seq in both B73 and rmr6 (PolIV mutant involved in siRNA biogenesis and in the RdDM pathway) after drought and salt stress application. Reference annotation based transcript assembly allowed the identification both of new expressed loci and splicing variants, improving the current maize transcriptome annotation. Many antisense transcripts matching on the opposite strand of annotated loci were also identified, while more than the 20% of transcripts represent non coding RNA belonging to four classes: siRNAs, shRNAs, lncRNAs and transposable elements (or their relics). Several lncRNAs are modulated by stress application while TE-related sequences are mainly expressed in rmr6 and up-regulated by the stress. Overall design: Total RNA-Seq analysis of maize leaves from wt and rmr6-1 mutant plants grown under 1) control conditions, 2) drought stress, 3) salt stress,  4) salt+drought stress.

In order to generate a global overview of Zea mexicana transcriptome data, 3 of complement DNA (cDNA) libraries were prepared from RNA isolated from root, stem, and leave mixed tissues of Zea Mexicana from Control (24?), Cold (4?) and Drought (PEG2000, 20%) treatments and each teatment has two repetitions. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were merged and de novo to generate all transcripts set by Trinity with default parameter, which will be treated as reference genome. The number of paired-reads of each sample were mapped to reference genome by Bowtie software v1.1.1 and the number of mapped reads were calculated by RSEM. qRT-PCR validation was performed using BIO-RAD CFX96 sequence detection system and SYBR Green assays. Results: Using RNA-Seq technology with the Trinity assembled method, we generated a seedling plant transcriptome at a sequencing size of 51.78Gb of Zea mays ssp. mexicana L. from pooled RNA samples which included control (CK), cold (4?) and drought (PEG2000, 20%) stressed plant samples. A total of 414,232,462 high quality clean reads were used to conduct de novo assembly and annotation of genes without reference genome information. All of these reads were assembled into 251,145 transcripts (N50 = 1,269 bp) and 184,280 unigenes (N50 = 923 bp). A total of 3,504 up-regulated and 1,220 down-regulated genes were detected under cold stress and 532 up-regulated and 82 down-regulated genes were detected under drought stress. A Venn diagram indicated that 208 genes were affected by both cold and drought stresses. 3 cold stress pathways and 5 drought related pathways showed significant KEGG pathways. Functional enrichment analyses identified many common or specific biological processes and gene sets in response to drought and cold stresses. The ABA dependent pathway, trehalose synthetic pathway and CBF6 gene of ICE1-CBF pathway may play important roles in the DEGs co-up-regulated by both stresses of Zea mays ssp. mexicana L.

Cold tolerance is a trait of particular interest in Miscanthus, given that Miscanthus is more temperate adapted than its C4 relatives maize, sorghum, and sugarcane. Here we provide genetic data from a germplasm collection from eastern Russia, at the northern extreme of the native range of Miscanthus. M. sinensis was found in maritime climates near Vladivostok (43.6Ã‚Â° N) and in southern Sakhalin (46.6Ã‚Â° N). M. sacchariflorus was found inland at latitudes as high as 49.3Ã‚Â° N, where M. sinensis was absent. Most M. sacchariflorus was diploid, but ~2% were tetraploids. RAD-seq SNPs and plastid microsatellites revealed very little population structure within the Russian collection of M. sacchariflorus. Genome-wide association analysis revealed significant SNP-trait associations with number of stems per unit area and stem diameter, measured at the collection site, in M. sacchariflorus. Given the plummeting cost of SNP genotyping using sequence-based methods, preliminary genome-wide association analysis may become routine for new germplasm collections, and will aid in the choice of accessions for breeding and further characterization. Our germplasm collection will be useful for breeding Miscanthus and sugarcane cultivars with improved adaptation to cold.",NA

Here, we identified 71 MAPKKK genes, of which 14 were novel, based on a computational analysis of the maize (Zea mays L.) genome. Using an RNA-seq analysis in the leaf, stem and root of maize under well-watered and drought-stress conditions, we identified 5,866 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 8 MAPKKK genes responsive to drought stress. Many of the DEGs were enriched in processes such as drought stress, abiotic stimulus, oxidation-reduction, and metabolic processes.  The other way round, DEGs involved in processes such as oxidation, photosynthesis, and starch, proline, ethylene, and salicylic acid metabolism were clearly co-expressed with the MAPKKK genes. Furthermore, a quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was performed to assess the relative expression levels of MAPKKKs.

The genome-wide context-specific differential DNA methylation patterns and their influence on gene expression have rarely been investigated in crop species. Profiling of DNA methylation in five maize (Zea mays) inbred lines found that while DNA methylation levels for >99% of the analyzed genomic regions are similar there are still 5,000 to 20,000 context-specific differentially methylated regions (DMRs) between any two genotypes. The analysis of identical-by-state genomic regions that have limited genetic variation provided evidence that DMRs can occur without local sequence variation but they are 50% less common than in regions with genetic variation. Characterization of the sequence-specificity of DMRs, location of DMRs relative to genes and transposons and patterns of DNA methylation in regions flanking DMRs reveals distinct subset of DMRs. RNAseq profiling of the same tissue revealed that only ~20% of genes with qualitative (on-off) differences in gene expression are associated with DMRs and there is little evidence for association of DMRs with genes that show quantitative differences in gene expression. We also identify a set of genes that may represent cryptic information that is silenced by DNA methylation in the reference B73 genome. Many of these genes exhibit natural variation in other genotypes suggesting the potential for selection to act upon existing epigenetic natural variation.

Larval performance of the three taxa was compared in a feeding bioassay on artificial pinto diet and maize leaves. On pinto diet all taxa showed good performance, while on maize the two taxa non-specialised on maize showed lower survival, growth rate, and pupal weight compared to the maize-specialist S. frugiperda C-strain. The differential metabolic responses after feeding on the two diets were characterized with RNA-Seq analysis of midgut transcriptomes from the 3rd instar larvae.

Substantial alteration in the expression levels of digestive and detoxifying enzymes, transporters, immunity, and peritrophic membrane associated transcripts was also documented in all the taxa to overcome maize defences. However, the expression level of detoxifying enzymes like UDP glucosyl transferases, which detoxify the most abundant maize leaf toxin 2, 4-dihydroxy-7-methoxy-1, 4-benzoxazin-3-one (DIMBOA), did not alter significantly after feeding on maize.

One proposed approach was to sequence individual BAC clones from a tiling path defined by combining genetic and physical mapping. Another focused on the non-repetitive (gene-rich) sequences while a third examined the most cost-effective method to determine the nucleotide sequence for the entire genome by examining a small portion. The National Science Foundation funded three sequencing projects in maize that tested the sequencing strategies for large plant genomes, using maize as an example.  The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=9872655>first </a> project funded under the NSF Plant Genome Initiative, toward genetic and physical mapping, was awarded to Ed Coe and colleagues at the University of Missouri along with Rod Wing of the University of Arizona and Andrew Paterson of the University of Georgia.  The question under test for maize was whether fingerprinted BACs could be assembled into contigs and pseudochromosomes. By combining genetic and physical strategies they derived a high-resolution genetic map; constructed and fingerprinted 450,000 BACs and assembled them into contigs; and anchored assemblies onto the genetic map, integrating the physical elements in genetic map order. These data and materials were staged for subsequent selection of a minimum tiling path and BAC-by-BAC sequencing, once the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated.   The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0221536>test project for non-repetitive sequences</a> was awarded to the Consortium for Maize Genomics. They tested two strategies, <b>methyl-filtration</b> and <b>high-Cot selection</b>, as a method to exclude repetitive DNA from the input to sequencing. The consortium members are The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, TIGR, Purdue University, and Orion Genomics. The underlying premise is that knowing the nucleotide sequence of the gene-space will be sufficient.  The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0211851>test project for sequencing and examining a portion of the genome</a> was awarded to Jo Messing at Rutgers University  along with Rod Wing and Cari Soderlund from the University of Arizona. They proposed to use a modified BAC-by-BAC sequencing strategy. They have sequenced about 20 Mb of the maize genome represented in 140 BAC clones. Sequencing was carried out at  the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research.  The Arizona Genomics Institute has sequenced about 450,000 BAC ends which aid in aligning BAC sequences to the genetic map using co-linearity of these sequences with the rice genomic sequence. Also a FPC map was produced by the Arizona Genomics Institute.  The results of the two preliminary genome sequencing efforts showed that the BAC-by-BAC approach was the only method suitable for reasonable quality data.

It progresses through three recognizable phases of pathogenic development *in planta*: melanized appressoria that form on the host surface prior to penetration; biotrophy, characterized by colonization of living host cells; and necrotrophy, characterized by host cell death and symptom development. An improved filtering algorithm and a Mixed Effects Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were developed and applied to an existing Illumina transcriptome dataset, substantially increasing the statistical power of the analysis of *C. graminicola* gene expression during infection and colonization. Additionally, the *in planta* transcriptome of the wild-type was compared with that of a mutant strain impaired in the establishment of biotrophy, allowing detailed dissection of events occurring specifically during penetration, and during early versus late biotrophy. Results indicated that there is a continuum of activities that occur during colonization of maize by *C. graminicola*, and that boundaries drawn between the three recognizable phases are artificial. More than 2000 fungal genes were differentially transcribed in waves during appressorial maturation, penetration, and colonization. Secreted proteins and membrane receptors were over-represented among the differentially expressed genes, suggesting that the fungus engages in an intimate and dynamic conversation with the host, beginning prior to penetration. This communication process is likely to involve reception of plant signals that trigger subsequent developmental progress in the fungus, as well as the production of signals that induce responses in the host. Later phases of biotrophy were more similar to necrotrophy, with increased production of secreted proteases, inducers of plant cell death, hydrolases, and membrane bound transporters for the uptake and egress of potential toxins, signals, and nutrients. The differentially expressed genes could be used as landmarks to more accurately identify developmental progress in compatible versus incompatible interactions involving genetic variants of both host and pathogen. Overall design: Analysis of C. graminicola colonization stages: pre-penetration appressoria (PA), early biotrophic phase (BP), and the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy (NP), in two different isolates, a wild-type (WT) and a non-pathogenic mutant (MT). There are 3 biological replicates per stage, except for the MTBP treatment with only 2 biological replicates. A total of four lanes (i.e. technical replicates) of data were generated for WTAP; one lane each was produced for WTBT and WTNT; and two lanes each were produced for MTAP and MTBT. The technical replicates for each treatment were pooled. The wild type strains of this study were submitted in GSE34632. The new wild type Samples combined reps.

Methodology/Principal findings:                 Forty male pigs (~40 days old) were blocked by weight and litter ancestry and                 assigned to one of four treatments; 1) Isogenic maize-based diet for 110 days                 (Isogenic); 2) Bt maize-based diet (MON810) for 110 days (Bt); 3) Isogenic                 maize-based diet for 30 days followed by a Bt maize-based diet for 80 days                 (Isogenic/Bt); 4) Bt maize-based diet for 30 days followed by an isogenic                 maize-based diet for 80 days (Bt/Isogenic). Using culture-based methods,                 Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus and total anaerobes were enumerated in the feces                 on days 0, 30, 60 and 100 of the study and in ileal and cecal digesta on day 110. No                 differences were found between treatments for any of these counts at any time point.                 The relative abundance of cecal bacteria was also determined using high-throughput                 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No differences were observed in any bacterial taxa between                 treatments, with the exception of the genus Holdemania which was more abundant in                 the cecum of pigs fed the isogenic/Bt treatment compared to pigs fed the Bt                 treatment (0.012 vs 0.003%; P = 0.05). Conclusions/Significance: Feeding pigs a Bt                 maize-based diet for 110 days did not affect counts of any of the culturable                 bacteria enumerated in the feces, ileum or cecum. Neither did it influence the                 composition of the cecal microbiota with the exception of a minor increase in the                 genus Holdemania. As the role of Holdemania in the intestine is still under                 investigation and no health abnormalities were observed, this change is not likely                 to be of clinical significance.

Abstract: The                 objective of this study was to investigate if feeding genetically modified (GM) Bt                 maize had any effects on the porcine intestinal microbiota. Eighteen pigs were                 weaned at ~28 days, and following a 6 day acclimatization period, were assigned to                 diets containing either GM (Bt MON810) or non-GM isogenic parent line maize for 31                 days. Effects on the porcine intestinal microbiota were assessed through                 culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Fecal, cecal and ileal counts of                 total anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus were not significantly                 different between pigs fed the isogenic or Bt maize-based diets. Furthermore,                 high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed few differences in the composition                 of the cecal microbiota. The only differences that were observed were that pigs fed                 the Bt maize-based diet had higher abundance of cecal Enterobacteriaceae (0.007 vs                 0.001; P <0.05), Helicobacteraceae (0.002 vs 0.0004; P gt;0.05), Helicobacter                 (0.002 vs 0.0004; P <0.05) and Bacteroides (0.001 vs 0.0005; P <0.05) compared                 to pigs fed the isogenic maize-based diet. Bt maize-fed pigs also had lower                 abundance of fibre-fermenting bacteria (Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium,                 Faecalibacterium, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, Bacteroides and Butyrivibrio) when these                 were analyzed as a group (0.13 vs 0.22; P <0.05). A lower concentration of enzyme                 resistant starch in the Bt maize may account for some of the differences in                 taxonomic distribution observed within the cecal microbiota. Overall, these results                 indicate that Bt maize is well tolerated at the level of the porcine intestinal                 microbiota and provide additional data for safety assessment of Bt maize.                 680.",NA

Rice, like most plant species, directly fixes carbon into C3 acid via the Calvin-Benson cycle. Maize, a semi-tropical plant, uses a two-step process with a C4 acid intermediate that reduces photorespiration and affords higher water and nitrogen use efficiencies under hot arid conditions. To define key innovations in C4 photosynthesis, we profiled metabolites and gene expression along a developing leaf gradient. A novel statistical method was implemented to compare transcriptomes from these two species along a unified leaf developmental gradient and define candidate cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors driving photosynthetic gene expression. We also present comparative primary and secondary metabolic profiles along the gradients that provide new insight into nitrogen and carbon metabolism in C3 and C4 grasses. The power of this comparative approach is illustrated by defining an aerial suberin biosynthetic pathway for maize and identifying transcriptional regulators of suberin biosynthesis, a novel innovation associated with C4 photosynthesis. These resources, including community viewers to access and mine these datasets, will enable the elucidation and engineering of C4 photosynthetic networks to improve the photosynthetic capacity of C3 and C4 grasses.",NA

One proposed approach was to sequence individual BAC clones from a tiling path defined by combining genetic and physical mapping. Another focused on the non-repetitive (gene-rich) sequences while a third examined the most cost-effective method to determine the nucleotide sequence for the entire genome by examining a small portion. The National Science Foundation funded three sequencing projects in maize that tested the sequencing strategies for large plant genomes, using maize as an example.  The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=9872655>first </a> project funded under the NSF Plant Genome Initiative, toward genetic and physical mapping, was awarded to Ed Coe and colleagues at the University of Missouri along with Rod Wing of the University of Arizona and Andrew Paterson of the University of Georgia.  The question under test for maize was whether fingerprinted BACs could be assembled into contigs and pseudochromosomes. By combining genetic and physical strategies they derived a high-resolution genetic map; constructed and fingerprinted 450,000 BACs and assembled them into contigs; and anchored assemblies onto the genetic map, integrating the physical elements in genetic map order. These data and materials were staged for subsequent selection of a minimum tiling path and BAC-by-BAC sequencing, once the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated.   The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0221536>test project for non-repetitive sequences</a> was awarded to the Consortium for Maize Genomics. They tested two strategies, <b>methyl-filtration</b> and <b>high-Cot selection</b>, as a method to exclude repetitive DNA from the input to sequencing. The consortium members are The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, TIGR, Purdue University, and Orion Genomics. The underlying premise is that knowing the nucleotide sequence of the gene-space will be sufficient.  The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0211851>test project for sequencing and examining a portion of the genome</a> was awarded to Jo Messing at Rutgers University  along with Rod Wing and Cari Soderlund from the University of Arizona. They proposed to use a modified BAC-by-BAC sequencing strategy. They have sequenced about 20 Mb of the maize genome represented in 140 BAC clones. Sequencing was carried out at  the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research.  The Arizona Genomics Institute has sequenced about 450,000 BAC ends which aid in aligning BAC sequences to the genetic map using co-linearity of these sequences with the rice genomic sequence. Also a FPC map was produced by the Arizona Genomics Institute.  The results of the two preliminary genome sequencing efforts showed that the BAC-by-BAC approach was the only method suitable for reasonable quality data.

However, the regulatory network that controls leaf development remains poorly understood. To tackle this issue, several leaf transcriptomic studies have been conducted. These studies have identified genes differentially expressed between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells or between different regions of a leaf. They have also provided a global picture of the transcriptional dynamics of genes in developing leaves during seed germination. Moreover, one study has identified cohorts of genes associated with procambium initiation and vascular patterning. In the present and a previous study, we have obtained 22 transcriptomes with a time span from hour 0 (dry seeds) to hour 192 post imbibition. Using these time series data, we studied gene up- and down-regulation and functional transition during leaf development, and we inferred 30 sets of strongly coexpressed genes, which showed different functional enrichments. More significantly, we developed methods to predict TF binding sites (TFBSs) and their cognate TFs. In addition, for a TF-TFBS pair known in one species, we developed a method to predict its orthologous TF-TFBS pair in another species. From these efforts, we predicted 1,459 TFBSs and 250 TF-TFBS pairs in the maize genome. Experimental tests of our predicted TF-TFBS pairs showed that our methods perform well. Thus, our study has greatly expanded the information of maize gene regulation during leaf development.",NA

These observations indicate that a single genome sequence might not reflect the entire genomic complement of a species, and prompted us to introduce the concept of the plant pan-genome, including core genomic features common to all individuals and a Dispensable Genome (DG) composed of partially shared and/or non shared DNA sequence elements. The very active transposable element systems present in many plant genomes may account for a large fraction of the DG. The mechanisms by which the CNV-like variants are generated and the direction of the mutational events are still unknown. Uncovering the intriguing nature of the DG, i.e. its composition, origin and function, represents a step forward towards an understanding of the processes generating genetic diversity and phenotypic variation. Additionally, since the DG clearly appears to be for the most part the youngest and most dynamic component of the pan genome, it is of great interest to understand whether it is a major contributor to the creation of new genetic variation in plant evolution and more specifically in the breeding process.",NA

The examination of maize genes and conserved non-coding sequences reveals that many of these are flanked by regions of elevated asymmetric CHH (where H is any base except G) methylation. These mCHH islands are quite short (~100bp) and are enriched near active genes. The analysis of DNA methylation in other sequence contexts and several chromatin modifications reveal that the mCHH island marks the transition from heterochromatin associated modifications to euchromatin associated modifications. The mCHH island often occurs at the edge of the transposon that is located nearest to the gene. The presence of a mCHH island is fairly consistent in several distinct tissues that were surveyed but shows some variation among different haplotypes. The presence of InDels in promoters often influences the presence and position of the mCHH island. The mCHH islands are dependent upon RNA-directed DNA methylation activities. The mCHH islands are lost in the mop1 and mop3 mutants but the nearby genes do not necessarily exhibit altered expression levels. Instead, the loss of the mCHH island often results in the erosion of heterochromatic marks into the nearby transposon. This suggests that mCHH islands and RNA-directed DNA methylation near maize genes may act to preserve the silencing of transposons from activity of the genes.",NA

A collection of mutant alleles for 11 maize genes predicted to play roles in controlling DNA methylation were isolated through forward- or reverse-genetics approaches. Low-coverage whole genome bisulfite sequencing and high-coverage sequence-capture bisulfite sequencing were applied to mutant lines to determine context- and locus-specific effects of these mutations on DNA methylation profiles. Plants containing mutant alleles for components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway exhibit loss of CHH methylation at many loci as well as CG and CHG methylation at a small number of loci. Those loci tend to have elevated CHH levels in wild-type plants relative to the average of genome-wide value, and are enriched for 21-nt to 24-nt small RNAs. Plants containing loss-of-function alleles for chromomethylase (CMT) genes exhibit strong genome-wide reductions in CHG methylation and some locus-specific loss of CHH methylation. There is evidence for two pathways mediating CHH methylation in maize with the RdDM pathway influencing CHH levels in regions near genes and in short length transposons, while an ortholog of the Arabidopsis CMT3 mediated pathway plays a role in CHH methylation present in long transposons, similar to the role played by CMT2 in Arabidopsis. In an attempt to identify stocks with stronger reductions in DNA methylation levels than provided by single gene mutations, we performed crosses to create double mutants for the maize CMT3 orthologs, Zmet2 and Zmet5, and for the maize DDM1 orthologs, Chr101 and Chr106. While loss-of-function alleles are viable as single gene mutants, the double mutants were not recovered, suggesting that severe perturbations of the maize methylome may have stronger deleterious phenotypic effects than in Arabidopsis.",NA

In primary root tissues, between 1,027 (elongation zone) and 1,206 (stele) SPE patterns were observed. As a consequence, hybrids displayed in each tissue >400 active genes more than either parent. Analysis of tissue-specific SPE dynamics revealed that 1,233 of 2,233 SPE genes displayed SPE in all tissues in which they were expressed while 1,000 SPE genes displayed in at least one tissue a non-SPE pattern.

However, the gene regulatory networks that control endosperm cell differentiation remain largely unclear. As a first step toward characterizing these networks, we profiled the mRNAs in five major cell types of the differentiating endosperm and in the embryo and four maternal compartments of the kernel. Comparisons of these mRNA populations revealed the diverged gene expression programs between filial and maternal compartments, and an unexpected close correlation between embryo and the aleurone layer of endosperm. Gene co-expression network analysis identified co-expression modules associated with single or multiple kernel compartments including modules for the endosperm cell types, some of which showed enrichment of previously identified temporally activated and/or imprinted genes. Detailed analyses of a co-expression module highly correlated with the basal endosperm transfer layer (BETL) identified a regulatory module activated by MRP-1, a regulator of BETL differentiation and function.

Annual crop rotation between corn and soybean (Glycine max) disrupts the corn-dependent WCR lifecycle and was widely adopted to manage WCR. However, this strategy selected for a rotation-resistant (RR) variant with reduced ovipositional fidelity to cornfields. Previous studies indicated that RR-WCR adults exhibit greater tolerance of soybean tissue diet, different gut physiology, and host-microbe interactions compared to wild-types (WT). To identify genetic mechanisms underlying these phenotypic changes, a de novo assembly of the WCR adult gut transcriptome was constructed and used for RNA-sequencing analyses on RNA libraries from different WCR phenotypes (RR and WT) fed with corn or soybean diets. Differential gene expression analyses and network-based methods were used to identify gene modules transcriptionally correlated with the RR phenotype. Gene ontology enrichment analyses on these modules were then conducted to understand their potential functions and biological importance.

All of these results indicate Mendelian factors play as major contributors to the transcriptome variation. Meanwhile, non-Mendelian regulations were also observed as paramutation-like expression pattern for 145 genes, of which 88% genes were predicted to be potential targets of miRNAs or ta-siRNAs, and as unexpected presence/absence expression patterns for 210 genes. These genes with unexpected presence/absence expression patterns in the RILs likely include examples of functional genes as well as transposed gene fragments that may contribute to regulatory variation of their ancestral syntenic genes.",NA

In derivatives of TB-9Sb, we found a de novo centromere on chromosome telo-3-3, which has no canonical centromeric repeat sequences. This centromere is derived from a 288-kb region on the short arm of chromosome 9, and is 19 megabases (Mb) removed from the translocation breakpoint of chromosome 9 in TB-9Sb.

Our data revealed that for individual genes fold-changes in histone modification and transcript abundance were much better correlated than absolute intensities. When focusing on regulated modification sites, we identified secondary upstream H3 lysine 9 acetylation peaks (SUPs) on upstream promoter regions of approximately 6% of all acetylated genes. SUPs showed stronger regulation than the previously described acetylation peaks at transcription initiation sites, were more often found on genes that were upregulated towards the maturing zone than on downregulated genes, and were significantly enriched on photosynthetic genes. We identified SUPs on all genes encoding enzymes of the C4 cycle. Moreover, SUPs were enriched in four lists of candidate C4-associated genes that were derived from previous transcriptomic studies. Based on these data, we used highly regulated SUPs as an epigenetic mark to identify new genes potentially involved in C4 metabolism. This approach also allowed the identification of ethylene response elements as highly enriched cis-acting elements in SUP regions.

These small RNAs play an essential role in the grasses and act to spatially define the expression domain of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3) transcription factors. However, contrary to tasiR-ARFsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ essential function in development, DCL4 proteins exhibit strong evidence of recurrent adaptation typical of host factors involved in antiviral immunity.

We show that, in contrast to other tasiR-ARF biogenesis mutants, dcl4 null alleles condition an uncharacteristically mild phenotype, correlated with normal expression of select arf3 targets. Loss of DCL4 activity yields a class of 22-nt tasiR-ARF variants associated with the processing of arf3 transcripts into 22-nt secondary siRNAs by DCL1.

After 2-3 days of re-culturing in SP nutrient solutions, half of the seedlings were transplanted into a low phosphate (LP, same composition as the SP solution, except that 5 Ã‚ÂµM KH2PO4 and 1 mM KH2PO4 were replaced with 1 mM KCl) nutrient solution. The plants were grown under a 32Ã‚Â°C/25Ã‚Â°C (day/night) temperature regime at a photon flux density (PFD) of 700 Ã‚Âµmol m-2 s-1 with a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle in a greenhouse with approximately 65% relative humidity. The roots and leaves were then harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 days and 8 days and cultured in SP solution (as a normal growth control) for small RNA analysis. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at -80? for further analysis. Each biological repeat contains segments from 15~20 plants. Total RNA was extracted as previously described in Molecular Cloning (Sambrook and Russell David, 1989) and was then subjected to two additional chloroform washes prior to nucleic acid precipitation. The small RNA digitalization analysis based on HiSeq high-throughput sequencing takes the SBS-sequencing by synthesis. Then the 50nt sequence tags from HiSeq sequencing will go through the data cleaning first, which includes getting rid of the low quality tags and several kinds of contaminants from the 50nt tags. Length distribution of clean tags are then summarized. Afterwards, the standard bioinformatics analysis will annotate the clean tags into different categories and take those which can not be annotated to any category to predict the novel miRNA and base edit of potential known miRNA. Compare the known miRNA expression between two samples to find out the differentially expressed miRNA. The procedures are shown as below:   (1)Normalize the expression of miRNA in two samples (control and treatment) to get the expression of transcript per million (TPM).       Normalization formula: Normalized expression = Actual miRNA count/Total count of clean reads*1000000   (2)Calculate fold-change and P-value from the normalized expression. Then generate the log2ratio plot and scatter plot.",NA

Ã¢â‚¬Å“HeterosisÃ¢â‚¬Â describes both this behavior and its underlying Mendelian and non-Mendelian interactions [1], although its molecular basis remains largely unknown.  Recent comparisons of small RNA (sRNA) profiles from parents and their heterotic progeny identified correlations between interparental 24-nucleotide (24-nt) RNA variation and non-additive 24-nt RNA changes in the resulting hybrid [2,3].  24-nt RNAs guide de novo cytosine methylation, and several proteins are required for their biogenesis, including a Snf2-like ATPase: required to maintain repression1 (RMR1) [4].  We found height variation between heterotic hybrids +/- RMR1 activity, implicating a role for RMR1 in heterosis.  Based on the published correlations mentioned above [2,3], we hypothesized that RMR1-loss reduces parental sRNAs, altering their relative ratios and changing the sRNA profiles in the resulting hybrid from those of a standard hybrid (from +RMR1 parents).  To probe this hypothesis, we profiled sRNAs from parents and hybrids +/- RMR1 function, limiting the parental diversity to only portions of chromosomes 6 and 9.  Our analysis will address how RMR1 loss changes hybrid sRNAs in the presence and absence of underlying genetic variation and help to determine how this loss results in different phenotypic outcomes from heterotic crosses. 1.

Kranz anatomy is characterized by closely spaced veins that are encircled by two morphologically distinct photosynthetic cell types. Although Kranz anatomy evolved multiple times, the underlying genetic mechanisms remain largely elusive, with only the maize scarecrow gene so far implicated in Kranz patterning. To provide a broader insight into the regulation of Kranz differentiation, we performed a genome-wide comparative analysis of developmental trajectories in Kranz (foliar leaf blade) and non-Kranz (husk leaf sheath) leaves of the C4 plant maize. Using profile classifica- tion of gene expression in early leaf primordia, we identified cohorts of genes associated with procam- bium initiation and vascular patterning. In addition, we used supervised classification criteria inferred from anatomical and developmental analyses of five developmental stages to identify candidate regula- tors of cell-type specification.

Many HD-Zip genes are characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and cucumber (Cucmis sativus). Findings in these species suggest HD-Zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement. Results In this study we have identified members of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean cv. 'Williams 82', and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. Homology searches with BLASTP and Hidden Markov Model guided sequence alignments identified 101 HD-Zip genes in the soybean genome. Phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, grape (Vitis vinifera), and Medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. Of the 101 HD-Zip genes identified in soybean, 88 exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in Glycine ~10 Mya. The HD-Zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across 24 conditions that include 17 tissues of soybean. An RNA-Seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at 0, 1, 6 and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified 20 differentially expressed (DE) genes. Several of these DE genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of HD-Zip gene functions across species. Screening of HD-Zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the DE genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of HD-Zip genes in abiotic stress responses. Conclusions We provide a thorough description of soybean HD-Zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. Expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element.

They potentially can reduce the use of chemicals in agriculture as an ecologically safe alternative, but to optimize the application of PGPR, more profound knowledge on specific gene regulation and molecular mechanisms of interaction with plants is needed. Advance in sequencing technologies made it affordable to compare transcriptom profiles of relative organisms to check to which extend PGPR strains or closely related species differ in their strategies of plant colonization. This work aimed at analysis of gene regulation in a biotechnological strain Bacillus atrophaeus UCMB-5137 to compare it with the gene expression profile of a generally recognized PGPR strain B. amyloliquefaciens FZB42. It was found out that despite the close taxonomic relatedness, these two organisms developed ability to colonize plants independently and use different strategies of plant colonization. Root exudate has triggered in UCMB-5137 alteration in expression in many genes controlled by stress response transcription factors (TF) SigB and SigD, while SigF, SigH, SigW, CcpA and several other TFs regulated genes associated with quorum sensing and biofilm formation, and adjusted the carbohydrate metabolism.

Extensive studies of miRNAs have been performed in model plants such as rice, Arabidopsis thaliana and other plants. However, the number of miRNAs discovered in maize is relatively low and little is known about miRNAs involved in the four stages during maize ear development. Here, we use deep-sequencing, miRNA microarray assays and computational methods to identify, pro?le, and describe conserved and non-conserved miRNAs at four developmental stages. A total of 27 conserved miRNA families were identi?ed in all four stages, In addition to known miRNAs, we also found 23 new maize-specific miRNAs together with their star strands. We have also shown that almost all of them originated from single genes. We have found that many known and new miRNAs showed temporally expression. Finally, a total of 251 transcripts (140 genes) targeted by 102 small RNAs including 98 miRNAs and 4 ta-siRNAs were identified by genomic-scale high-throughput sequencing of miRNA cleaved mRNAs.This study led to the confirmation of the authenticity of 27 conserved miRNA families and the discovery of 23 novel miRNAs in maize. In addition, we have identified 130 targets of known and new miRNAs and ta-siRNA using recently developed tools for the global identification of miRNA targets.

The phenotypes conditioned by mutation of lbl1 and SGS3 are, however, strikingly different, suggesting that the activities of these small RNA biogenesis components, or the tasiRNAs and their targets might not be entirely conserved. To investigate the basis for this phenotypic variation, we compared the small RNA content between wild-type and lbl1 seedling apices. We show that LBL1 affects all major classes of small RNAs, and reveal unexpected crosstalk between tasiRNA biogenesis and other small RNA pathways regulating miRNAs, retrotransposons, and DNA transposons. We further identified genomic regions generating phased siRNAs, including numerous loci generating 22-nt phased small RNAs from long hairpin RNAs or overlapping antisense transcripts not previously described in other plant species. By combining both analyses, we identified nine TAS loci, all belonging to the conserved TAS3 family. Contrary to other plant species, no TAS loci targeted by a single miRNA were identified. Information from target prediction, RNAseq, and PARE analyses identified the tasiARFs as the major functional tasiRNAs in the maize vegetative apex where they regulate expression of ARF3 homologs. As such, divergence in TAS pathways is unlikely to account for the distinct phenotypes of tasiRNA biogenesis mutants in Arabidopsis and maize. Instead, the data suggests variation in the spatiotemporal regulation of ARF3, or divergence in its function, as a plausible basis for the dramatic phenotypic differences observed upon mutation of SGS3/lbl1 in Arabidopsis and maize.

The cob was featured by preferential expression of 161 genes, with striking enrichment of genes that are involved in transport facilitation and energy metabolism, consistent with the physiological role of the cob in C/N storage and transfer during ear development. The florets were characteristic of preferential expression of 108 genes, with enrichment of genes that are involved in the cellular process and lipid biosynthetic process. LN caused differential expression of 588 genes in the cob and only 195 genes in florets, indicating that the cob dominated the response of the ear to LN at the transcriptional level. Differentially expressed genes under LN were involved in C/N metabolism, transcriptional regulation, development, cell rescue and defense, and signal transduction in the cob and/or florets. The expression level of 106 genes was regulated by LN in both tissues, suggesting a common regulatory network in these two functionally distinct tissues under LN.

Here we report on a maize GWAS that identified TASs underlying five quantitative traits measured across a large panel of samples and examine the characteristics of these TASs. A set of SNPs obtained via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), most of which are located within annotated genes (~87%) were complemented with additional SNPs from the maize HapMap Project that contains approximately equal proportions of intragenic and intergenic SNPs. TASs were identified via a genome scan while controlling for polygenic background effects. The diverse functions of TAS-containing candidate genes indicate that complex genetic networks shape these traits. The vast majority of the TAS-containing candidate genes have dynamic expression levels among developmental stages. Overall, TASs explain 44~54% of the total phenotypic variation for these traits, with equal contributions from intra- and inter-genic TASs. Association of ligueless2 with upper leaf angle was implicated by two intragenic TASs; rough sheath1 was associated with leaf width by an upstream intergenic TAS; and Zea agamous5 was associated with days to silking by both intra- and inter-genic TASs. A large proportion (82%) of these TASs comes from noncoding regions, similar to findings from human diseases and traits.

We revealed that: Much of the variation (the population mean, the coefficient of variation) of gene expression levels in RILs is reflective of differences present among the parents; These transcriptome variations could be explained by 30,774 eQTLs with 96 trans-eQTL hotspots; In many cases, the genes commonly regulated by a trans-eQTL hotspot are enriched for a specific function or act in the same genetic pathway; Structural variation within and near genes contributs to cis-regulatory variation.

We used Illumina sequencing to assess how sRNA populations vary between two maize inbred lines (B73, Mo17) and their hybrid. We sampled sRNAs from the seedling shoot apex and the developing ear, two rapidly growing tissues that program the greater growth of maize hybrids. We found that parental differences in siRNAs primarily originate from repeat regions. Although the maize genome contains greater number and complexity of repeats compared to Arabidopsis or rice, we confirmed that like these simpler plant genomes, 24-nt siRNAs whose abundance differs between maize parents also show a trend of downregulation following hybridization. Surprisingly, hybrid vigor is fully maintained when 24-nt siRNAs are globally reduced by mutation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase2 (RDR2) encoded by modifier of paramutation1 (mop1). We also discovered that 21-22nt siRNAs derived from a number of distinct retrotransposon families differentially accumulate between B73 and Mo17 as well as their hybrid. Thus, maize possesses a novel source of genetic variation for regulating both transposons and genes at a genomic scale, which may contribute to its high degree of observed heterosis. Overall design: sRNA libraries were derived from RNA isolated from the seedling shoot apex and developing ear tissues from B73, Mo17, B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73. The shoot apex was chosen because it is enriched for meristematic tissue where cell proliferation occurs, rates of organ initiation are determined, and organ size is specified. The developing ear was examined because it is enriched in meristematic tissue and is undergoing rapid growth, and also because the mature ear shows the highest degree of heterosis.

To address this question we used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to detect differences in diversity, composition and/or relative abundance of bacterial taxa from an area covered by pristine forest and eight years old grassland surrounded by this forest. After removing the natural forest, the soil bacterial community did not suffer a great differentiation.

Overall, forest samples and grassland samples presented the same diversity and the clustering analysis did not show the occurrence of very distinctive bacterial communities between environments. However, we detected eleven OTUs in statistically significantly higher abundance in the forest samples but in lower abundance in the grassland samples and twelve OTUs in statistically significantly higher abundance in the grassland samples but in lower abundance in the forest samples.

In order to investigate disease-resistance mechanisms at this early seedling stage, digital gene expression (DGE) analysis, which applies a dual-enzyme approach (DpnII and NlaIII), was used to identify the transcriptional changes in roots of Huangzao4 (susceptible) and Mo17 (resistant) after inoculation with teliospores of S. reilianum. Before and after inoculation, pathogenesis-related genes were differentially regulated and enzymes involved in controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels showed different activity between Huangzao4 and Mo17, which can potentially lead to changes in the growth of S. reilianum and ROS production in maize. Moreover, lignin depositions of roots were also changed differentially during root colonization of hyphae between Huangzao4 and Mo17. These results suggest that the interplays between S. reilianum and maize during the early infection stage involve many interesting transcriptional and physiological changes, which offer several novel insights for understanding the mechanisms of resistance to the fungal infection.

Despite their importance for plant development, the genomic network targeted by KNOX proteins is poorly understood. Using ChIP-seq, we defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci. To understand how these binding occupancies correlate with changes in transcriptional regulation, we performed RNA-seq on immature ears and tassels, and compared expression profiles between normal and loss-of-function kn1 plants, in addition to immature leaves from normal and gain-of-function Kn1 plants. We found that 643 of the KN1 targets were modulated in one or multiple tissues, with a strong enrichment for transcription factors (including other homeobox genes) and genes participating in several hormonal pathways, most significantly auxin, implicating KN1 at the crossroads of plant hormone signaling. The loss-of-function kn1 phenotype is reminiscent of auxin mutants and kn1 mis-expression in leaves correlates with increased auxin signaling. Our results demonstrate that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant meristem identity and function.

We screened the microbial diversity across a land use transect via high throughput sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Land use had a major effect on soil properties and microbial community structures. Total organic carbon (TOC) and pH were major diversity drivers for Bacteria, while pH was important for Archaea. We identified the potential contribution of soil amendments to the indigenous microbial communities, and also gained insights about potential roles of taxa in the organic carbon turnover. Verrucomicrobia, coincided with the higher values of the recalcitrant organic carbon while Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria correlated with the more labile organic carbon.

The recently developed Hi-C technology is an efficacious method to investigate genome packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intra-chromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions and which represent a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction and they are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1 and H3.3. We also identify over 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not the dominant feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found over 1,000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions similar to the interior of TADs. These insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions show strong enrichment for distinct epigenetic marks, and correlate with gene transcription levels. We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity all contribute to shaping the local structure of the A. thaliana nuclear genome.",NA

The maize leaf is an ideal system to study plant morphogenesis as it is subdivided into a proximal sheath and a distal blade, each with distinct developmental patterning. Specialised ligule and auricle structures form at the blade-sheath boundary. The auricles act as a hinge, allowing the leaf blade to project at an angle from the stem, while the ligule comprises an epidermally-derived fringe. Recessive liguleless1 mutants lack ligules and auricles, and have upright leaves. We utilized laser-microdissection RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed along discrete cell/tissue-specific domains along the proximal-distal axis of wild-type leaf primordia undergoing ligule initiation, and compared transcript accumulation in wild type and liguleless1 mutant leaf primordia. We identified transcripts that are specifically upregulated at the blade-sheath boundary. A surprising number of these ligule genes are also implicated to function during leaf initiation or lateral branching, and intersect multiple hormonal signalling pathways. We propose that genetic modules utilised in leaf and/or branch initiation are redeployed to regulate ligule outgrowth from leaf primordia. Overall design: In this study, we analysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary.

Natural sources of resistance from maize genotypes are used in conventional breeding approaches, but the signals and effectors involved in resistance in this important crop species are not well understood. Early transcriptional changes associated with F. verticillioides infection were analysed in resistant CO441 and susceptible CO354 maize genotypes using RNA-Sequencing technology. Transcript level were measured at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi), reflecting the time point immediately preceding the onset of resistance in CO441, as determined by the absolute quantification of the fungal ÃƒÅ¸-tubulin2 gene. More than 100 million sequence reads were generated for condition (inoculated/uninoculated). The sequence reads were analyzed to measure gene expression levels and determine single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 2,551 transcripts with statistically significant differential expression before inoculation by comparing uninoculated control samples. Overall, a more induced expression of genes distributed in all functional classes is found in the CO441 genotype, in particular a high percentage of differentially genes were more expressed only in the resistant genotype for the functional class secondary metabolism. Furthermore, a total of 2,250 and 2,442 transcripts were differentially regulated after F. verticillioides inoculation in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The genes in common were 1,028 genes and showed 5,342 SNPs variants, suggesting a certain variability in the defense responses of the two genotypes. Also at 72 hpi, secondary metabolism was the category where the most interesting differences between the two genotypes were observed to a greater extent. Pathways related to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (e.g. anthranilate synthase, shikimate kinase), flavonoid biosynthesis (e.g. chalcone synthase) and lignin biosynthesis (e.g. cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase) appeared to be strongly influenced by infection in the CO441 genotype with up to 11-fold induction. Response to stress and resistance categories followed. In addition, transcriptional modulation affected signal transduction, including calcium signaling, ethylene signaling, MAP kinases, receptor-like kinases, and numerous transcription factors. Even though all these genes were well represented in both genotypes, it was observed that on the whole CO441 mounts a stronger gene induction, confirming its strengthening also in the specific response to inoculation. The identification of plant candidate resistance genes that interact with fungus could be exploited in future biotechnological approaches to increase disease resistance in susceptible maize genotypes.",NA

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats.

Based on the published correlations mentioned above [2,3], we hypothesized that RMR1-loss reduces parental sRNAs, altering their relative ratios and changing the sRNA profiles in the resulting hybrid from those of a standard hybrid (from +RMR1 parents).  To probe this hypothesis, we profiled sRNAs from parents and hybrids +/- RMR1 function, limiting the parental diversity to only portions of chromosomes 6 and 9.

Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line.

Deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from 14 days after pollination maize endosperm and embryo tissue was used to identify imprinted genes in a set of ~12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms in the B73 and Mo17 genotypes.  The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs).  Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes.  The 100 imprinted genes are distributed throughout the maize genome with little evidence for any clustering.  A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes.  The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by specific hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested.  Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns.  The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice and Arabidopsis and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.  The genes that are imprinted in multiple species may provide insights into the conserved functions of imprinting.","The data presented here contains the RNA-seq reads used in the analysis for this manuscript.

CMT3 genome locations nearly perfectly correlated with H3K9me2 and CMT3 stably associated with H3K9me2-containing nucleosomes. Crystal structures of maize CMT3 homologue, ZMET2, in complex with H3K9me2 peptides, showed that ZMET2 binds H3K9me2 via both BAH and chromo domains. The structures reveal an aromatic cage within both BAH and chromo domains as interaction interfaces that capture H3K9me2.

Thus, the interaction between TEs and siRNAs is a critical aspect of both the function and the evolution of plant genomes. Yet the co-evolutionary dynamics between these two entities remains poorly characterized. Here we studied the organization of TEs within the maize (Zea mays ssp mays) genome, documenting that TEs fall within three groups based on the class and copy numbers. These groups included DNA elements, low copy RNA elements and higher copy RNA elements. The three groups varied statistically in characteristics that included length, location, age, siRNA expression and 24:22 nucleotide (nt) siRNA targeting ratios. In addition, the low copy retroelements encompassed a set of TEs that had previously been shown to decrease expression within a 24 nt siRNA biogenesis mutant (mop1). To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of the three groups, we estimated their abundance in two landraces, one with a genome similar in size to that of the maize reference and the other with a 30% larger genome.

Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA.

Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.

To investigate the basis for this phenotypic variation, we compared the small RNA content between wild-type and lbl1 seedling apices. We show that LBL1 affects all major classes of small RNAs, and reveal unexpected crosstalk between tasiRNA biogenesis and other small RNA pathways regulating miRNAs, retrotransposons, and DNA transposons.

Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs).   This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches.  By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with 2-3 fold higher efficiency.  This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity.  The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolf Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively.  An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping.  In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tags becomes the reference.  Alternatively, for phylogenetic analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the reads can simply be treated as dominant markers.

By this method, Class 2 DNA elements were found significantly more often in genic regions than Class 1 RNA elements, but Class 1 elements were found more often near other TEs. Overall, we found that both Class1 and 2 TE families account for 70% of the genome size difference between B73 and luxurians. Interestingly, the relative abundance of TE families was conserved between species (r=0.99), suggesting genome-wide control of TE content rather than family-specific effects.",NA

DNA methylation can impact the transposable element (TE) silencing, gene imprinting and regulate gene expression.Through a genome-wide analysis, DNA methylation peaks were respectively characterized and mapped in maize embryo and endosperm genome. Distinct methylation level across maize embryo and endosperm was observed. The maize embryo genome contained more DNA methylation peaks than endosperm. However, the endosperm chloroplast genome contained more DNA methylation peaks to compare with the embryo chloroplast genome. DNA methylation regions were characterized and mapped in genome. More CG island (CGI) shore are methylated than CGI in maize suggested that DNA methylation level is not positively correlated with CpG density. The DNA methylation occurred more frequently in the promoter sequence and transcriptional termination region (TTR) than other regions of the genes. The result showed that 99% TEs we characterized are methylated in maize embryo, but some (34.8%) of them are not methylated in endosperm. Maize embryo and endosperm exhibit distinct pattern/level of methylation. The most differentially methylated two regions between embryo and endosperm are High CpG content promoters (HCPs) and high CpG content TTRs (HCTTRs). DNA methylation peaks distinction of mitochondria and chloroplast DNA were less than the nucleus DNA. Our results indicated that DNA methylation is associated with the gene silencing or gene activation in maize endosperm and embryo. Many genes involved in embryogenesis and seed development were found differentially methylated in embryo and endosperm. We found 17 endosperm-specific expressed imprinting genes were hypomethylated in endosperm and were hypermethylated in embryo. The expression of a maize DEMETER -like (DME-like) gene and MBD101 gene (MBD4 homolog) which direct bulk genome DNA demethylation were higher in endosperm than in embryo. These two genes may be associated with the distinct methylation level across maize embryo and endosperm.The methylomes of maize embryo and endosperm was obtained by MeDIP-seq method. The global mapping of maize embryo and endosperm methylation in this study broadened our knowledge of DNA methylation patterns in maize genome, and provided useful information for future studies on maize seed development and regulation of metabolic pathways in different seed tissues.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

For 25 families, expression was verified by deep-sequencing of small RNA libraries that were prepared from an assortment of maize tissues. PCR-RACE amplification of 68 miRNA transcript precursors, representing 18 families conserved across several plant species, showed that splice variation and the use of alternative transcriptional start and stop sites is common within this class of genes. Comparison of sequence variation data from diverse maize inbred lines versus teosinte accessions suggest that the mature miRNAs are under strong purifying selection while the flanking sequences evolve equivalently to other genes. Since maize is derived from an ancient tetraploid, the effect of whole-genome duplication on miRNA evolution was examined. We found that, like protein-coding genes, duplicated miRNA genes underwent extensive gene-loss, with ~35% of duplicate homeologous miRNA genes retained. This number is higher than that observed with protein-coding genes. A search for putative miRNA targets indicated a bias towards genes in regulatory and metabolic pathways.

We applied sequencing approaches to quantify RNA expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification distributions genome-wide in maize (Zea mays), focusing on centromeres and pericentromeres. Aside from the presence of the Histone H3 variant common to all centromeres, Centromeric Histone H3 (CENH3), we found no RNA expression or chromatin modifications that clearly differentiate centromeres from the immediate flanking regions. In general, both RNA expression and chromatin modification frequencies were a function of distance from the centromere, either peaking or dipping toward arms, with the vertices within the centromere. These results do not lend themselves well to models suggesting that specialized heterochromatic regions are required to enable centromere function. Our data suggest that visible pericentromeric heterochromatin in maize and many other species reflects the sharp transition between CENH3 chromatin and H3 chromatin and gradual distance-correlated changes similar to the frequency of recombination in flanking regions.","In this study, we compared siRNA abundance across centromere/pericentromere regions of maize chromosomes by Illumina sequencing a library of small RNAs (selecting for species with 5' and 3' ends already compatible for ligation, i.e., 5' monophosphates and 3' hydroxyls).

Although widely exploited in agriculture, the mechanisms responsible for heterosis are not well understood.  As a monoecious organism, a given maize plant can be used as both male and female parents of crosses.  Regardless of the cross direction, the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 produce hybrids that substantially out-perform their parents.  These reciprocal hybrids differ phenotypically from each other despite having identical nuclear genomes.  Consistent with these phenotypic observations, 30-50% of genes were differentially expressed between these reciprocal hybrids.  An eQTL experiment conducted to better understand the regulation of gene expression in inbred and hybrid lines detected ~4,000 eQTL associations.  The majority of these eQTL act in trans to regulate expression of genes on other chromosomes.  Surprisingly, many of the trans-eQTL, when heterozygous, differentially regulated transcript accumulation in a manner consistent with gene expression in the hybrid being regulated exclusively by the paternally transmitted allele.  The design of the eQTL experiment controlled for cytoplasmic and maternal effects, suggesting that widespread paternal genomic imprinting contributes to the regulation of gene expression in maize hybrids. Keywords: eQTL, parent-of-origin Overall design: GPL4521 - SAM1.2 (Reciprocal Hybrid Comparison): Six replications of B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73 were grown in growth chambers to tightly control environmental variation.  Seeds from each genotype were taken from a single source (ear) for all six replications.  Within each replication, genotypes were randomly assigned growth locations.  Six healthy seedlings for each genotype and replication were harvested at two weeks of age.  For each replication, B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73 were hybridized to the SAM1.2 microarray (GPL4521) using a randomized, alternate dye assignment. GPL3333 - SAM1.1 and GPL3538 - SAM3.0 (eQTL Experiment): Four biological replications of the RIL, B73xRIL, and Mo17xRIL cross-types were planted in growth chambers using seed from a single source for each genotype.   Each RIL and its crosses onto B73 and Mo17 were planted using a split-plot design with RIL group (RIL and its cross onto B73 and Mo17) as the whole-plot treatment factor and cross-type (RIL, B73xRIL, and Mo17xRIL) as the split-plot treatment factor.  The whole-plot portion of the experiment was designed as a randomized complete block design with four replications carried out on four separate occasions in the same environment.  For the split-plot portion of the design, twelve seedlings of each RIL and its crosses were randomized within two adjacent flats in a growth chamber (six healthy seedlings per genotype were randomly chosen and pooled at harvest).  For each replication, RIL, B73xRIL, and Mo17xRIL cross-types were hybridized to custom cDNA microarrays using a loop design such that each loop included all pairwise comparisons between the RIL and its crosses with B73 and Mo17.  Four biological replications were hybridized to the SAM1.1 (GPL3333) array and two of the four biological replications were hybridized to SAM3.0 (GPL3538).  RNA samples were alternately labeled to provide dye balance within each loop and replication.

RNAÃ¢â‚¬â€œdependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) is a component of the RNAÃ¢â‚¬â€œdirected DNA methylation (RdDM) silencing pathway. In maize, loss of mediator of paramutation1 (mop1) encoded RDR2 function results in reactivation of transcriptionally silenced Mu transposons and a substantial reduction in the accumulation of 24 nt short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that recruit RNA silencing components. An RNAÃ¢â‚¬â€œseq experiment conducted on shoot apical meristems (SAMs) revealed that, as expected based on a model in which RDR2 generates 24 nt siRNAs that suppress expression, most differentially expressed DNA TEs (78%) were up-regulated in the mop1 mutant. In contrast, most differentially expressed retrotransposons (68%) were down-regulated. This striking difference suggests that distinct silencing mechanisms are applied to different silencing templates. In addition, 6,000 genes (24% of analyzed genes), including nearly 80% (286/361) of genes in chromatin modification pathways, were differentially expressed. Overall, two-thirds of differentially regulated genes were down-regulated in the mop1 mutant. This finding suggests that RDR2 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of not only transposons, but also of genes. A re-analysis of existing small RNA data identified both RDR2Ã¢â‚¬â€œsensitive and RDR2Ã¢â‚¬â€œresistant species of 24 nt siRNAs that we hypothesize may at least partially explain the complex changes in the expression of genes and transposons observed in the mop1 mutant.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the two major types, both of which have a demonstrated and important role in plant development, stress responses and pathogen resistance. In this work, we used a deep sequencing approach (Sequencing-By-Synthesis, or SBS) to develop sequence resources of small RNAs from different maize tissues (including leaves, ears and tassels) collected from wild-type plants of the B73 variety. The high depth of the resulting datasets enabled us to examine in detail critical small RNA features as size distribution, tissue-specific regulation and sequence conservation between different organs in this species. We also developed database resources and a dedicated website (http://smallrna.udel.edu/) with computational tools for allowing other users to identify new miRNAs or siRNAs involved in specific regulatory pathways, verify the degree of conservation of these sequences in other plant species and map small RNAs on genes or larger regions of the maize genome under study. Overall design: Small RNA libraries were derived from leaves, ears and tassels of maize variety B73 (wild-type). Plants were grown in a flood irrigated plot at the University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ, USA) in 2007 and organs were pooled from several plants for each library. Young leaves were collected from 6-weeks-old seedlings. Post-meiotic immature ears were harvested from 10- and 11-week old plants while pre-meiotic tassels were collected from 8-week old plants. Total RNA was isolated using the Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) and submitted to Illumina (Hayward, CA, http://www.illumina.com) for small RNA library construction using approaches described in (Lu et al., 2007) with minor modifications. The small RNA libraries were sequenced with the Sequencing-By-Synthesis (SBS) technology by Illumina. PERL scripts were designed to remove the adapter sequences and determine the abundance of each distinct small RNA.

Here we explore the impact of four bioenergy feedstock crops (maize, switchgrass, Miscanthus X giganteus, and mixed tallgrass prairie) on nitrogen cycling microorganisms in the soil. By analyzing key functional genes (nifH, bacterial amoA, archaeal amoA and nosZ) and 16S rRNA genes, we monitored changes in the quantity (real-time PCR) and diversity (barcoded pyrosequencing) of diazotrophic bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), denitrifying bacteria and the overall bacterial/archaeal community over two years after crop establishment. Over time, the quantities of these N-cycling genes were relatively stable in all the crops, except maize (the only fertilized crop), in which the population size of AOB doubled in less than 3 months, and denitrifier abundance increased in comparison to the other crops in the second season. Deep sequencing revealed high diversity of nifH, archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nosZ and 16S rRNA genes, with 10899, 3187, 3945, 11242 and 19824 unique nucleotide sequences observed, respectively. Rarefaction analysis revealed the diversity of archaeal amoA in maize significantly decreased in the second year. Among the observed bacterial genera, covering nine phyla, 31.8% were significantly changed in at least one crop. Unifrac PCoA  analysis showed that the N-transforming microbial community structures in the soil under these crops changed following different trajectories. Thus far, our two year study has shown that specific N-transforming microbial communities develop in the soil in response to planting different bioenergy crops, and each functional group responded in a different way. Our results also suggest that application of fertilizer increases the abundance of AOB and denitrifiers, reduces the diversity of AOA, and significant changes in the structure of these N-transforming populations.",NA

However, the evolutionary path from a neocentromere to a mature centromere has been elusive. Here we analyzed the centromeres of six chromosomes that were transferred from maize into oat as the result of an inter-species cross. Centromere size and location were assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation for the histone variant CENH3, which is a defining feature of functional centromeres. Maize and oat are highly divergent and differ in genome size by four fold. Two isolates of maize chromosome proved to contain neocentromeres in the sense that they had moved from the original site, whereas the remaining seven centromeres (1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10) were retained in the same area in both species. In all cases the CENH3-binding domains were dramatically expanded to encompass a larger area in the oat background (~4 Mb) than the average centromere size in maize (~2 Mb). The expansion of maize centromeres appeared to be restricted by the transcription of genes located in regions flanking the original centromeres. The results from the current study provide evidence that (1) centromere size is regulated; (2) centromere sizes tend to be uniform within a species regardless of chromosome size or origin of the centromere; and (3) neocentromeres emerge and expand preferentially in gene poor regions. Our results, together with data from several animal species, suggest that centromere size expansion may be a key factor in the survival of neocentric chromosomes in natural populations. Overall design: Using ChIP-seq with CenH3 antibody, we defined the functional centromere regions in  9 oat-maize additional lines. Two oat maize additional lines include maize chromosome 3 in oats background (OMA3.01 and neoM3). The other lines include maize chromosome 1,2,5,6,8,9, and 10, respectively.",NA

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

To explore global expression patterns and dissect the underlying genetic mechanisms are important scientific inquires which are still largely unknown, especially between a segregating population and the parents. In our study, we used RNA-Seq to profile the shoot apex transcriptome variation (including protein coding genes and non-coding genes) in maize IBM RIL population, to map eQTLs underlying the transcriptome variations and to utilize eQTLs to clone genes involved in maize shoot apices development. We revealed that: Much of the variation (the population mean, the coefficient of variation) of gene expression levels in RILs is reflective of differences present among the parents; These transcriptome variations could be explained by 30,774 eQTLs with 96 trans-eQTL hotspots; In many cases, the genes commonly regulated by a trans-eQTL hotspot are enriched for a specific function or act in the same genetic pathway; Structural variation within and near genes contributs to cis-regulatory variation. All of these results indicate Mendelian factors play as major contributors to the transcriptome variation. Meanwhile, non-Mendelian regulations were also observed as paramutation-like expression pattern for 145 genes, of which 88% genes were predicted to be potential targets of miRNAs or ta-siRNAs, and as unexpected presence/absence expression patterns for 210 genes.

Deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from 14 days after pollination maize endosperm and embryo tissue was used to identify imprinted genes in a set of ~12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms in the B73 and Mo17 genotypes.  The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs).  Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes.  The 100 imprinted genes are distributed throughout the maize genome with little evidence for any clustering.  A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes.  The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by specific hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested.  Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns.  The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice and Arabidopsis and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.

Despite their importance for plant development, the genomic network targeted by KNOX proteins is poorly understood. Using ChIP-seq, we defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci. To understand how these binding occupancies correlate with changes in transcriptional regulation, we performed RNA-seq on immature ears and tassels, and compared expression profiles between normal and loss-of-function kn1 plants, in addition to immature leaves from normal and gain-of-function Kn1 plants. We found that 643 of the KN1 targets were modulated in one or multiple tissues, with a strong enrichment for transcription factors (including other homeobox genes) and genes participating in several hormonal pathways, most significantly auxin, implicating KN1 at the crossroads of plant hormone signaling. The loss-of-function kn1 phenotype is reminiscent of auxin mutants and kn1 mis-expression in leaves correlates with increased auxin signaling. Our results demonstrate that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant meristem identity and function. Overall design: For loss-of-function mutant, kn1-e1 homozygote were compared to heterozygote or wild-type siblings (ears, tassels and shoot apical meristem). For gain-of-function mutant, Kn1-N homozygote were compared to wild-type siblings.Kn1-N heterozygote were compared to wild-type siblings.

Here we report on a maize GWAS that identified TASs underlying five quantitative traits measured across a large panel of samples and examine the characteristics of these TASs. A set of SNPs obtained via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), most of which are located within annotated genes (~87%) were complemented with additional SNPs from the maize HapMap Project that contains approximately equal proportions of intragenic and intergenic SNPs. TASs were identified via a genome scan while controlling for polygenic background effects. The diverse functions of TAS-containing candidate genes indicate that complex genetic networks shape these traits. The vast majority of the TAS-containing candidate genes have dynamic expression levels among developmental stages. Overall, TASs explain 44~54% of the total phenotypic variation for these traits, with equal contributions from intra- and inter-genic TASs. Association of ligueless2 with upper leaf angle was implicated by two intragenic TASs; rough sheath1 was associated with leaf width by an upstream intergenic TAS; and Zea agamous5 was associated with days to silking by both intra- and inter-genic TASs. A large proportion (82%) of these TASs comes from noncoding regions, similar to findings from human diseases and traits. However, TASs were enriched in both intergenic (53%) and promoter 5kb (24%) regions, but under-represented in a set of nonsynonymous SNPs.",NA

Deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from 14 days after pollination maize endosperm and embryo tissue was used to identify imprinted genes in a set of ~12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms in the B73 and Mo17 genotypes.  The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs).  Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes.  The 100 imprinted genes are distributed throughout the maize genome with little evidence for any clustering.  A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes.  The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by specific hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested.  Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns.  The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice and Arabidopsis and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.  The genes that are imprinted in multiple species may provide insights into the conserved functions of imprinting.","The data presented here contains the RNA-seq reads used in the analysis for this manuscript.

Here, we generated the integrated maps of transcriptomes and epigenomes of shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids, and globally surveyed the epigenetic variations and their relationships with transcriptional divergence between different tissues and different genotypes. We observed that whereas histone modifications vary both between tissues and between genotypes, DNA methylation patterns are more distinguishable between genotypes than between tissues. Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between tissues and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements (TEs), and for different TEs in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species. Together, our results suggest that despite of the variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different tissues of maize hybrids.

The application of novel and robust statistical approaches and a suitable experimental design established that 35,202 (i.e., 89%) of all high-confidence maize genes were expressed in at least one genotype. Nearly 60% (20,889/35,202) of all expressed genes were differentially expressed between the two parents and 34% to 47% of expressed genes were differentially expressed between one of the parents and one of the hybrids.

As a consequence of these types of complementation, both hybrids expressed more genes than did either parental inbred.

Resistant Mp708 thwarts feeding by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda [J.E. Smith]; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), numerous other lepidopteran pests, and the coleopteran western corn rootworm.  This broad resistance makes it an excellent model for studying native host plant resistance mechanisms.  In response to caterpillar feeding, Mp708 rapidly mobilizes Mir1-CP, a unique cysteine protease that appears to translocate from roots to the maize midwhorl where it accumulates.  This accumulation correlates with a significant reduction in caterpillar growth resulting from diminished food utilization.  In addition, the peritrophic membrane (PM) that surrounds the food bolus in the mudgut (MG) is severely damaged in caterpillars fed on sweet corn callus transformed to express the gene encoding Mir1-CP or on midwhorl tissue from resistant Mp708 maize.  Functions of the PM include assisting digestion and protecting the epithelium of the caterpillar MG from physical and chemical damage.  Consequently, the reduced growth of caterpillars that feed on Mp708 is probably due to the action of Mir1-CP on PM physiology. In fact, previous in vitro studies indicated that Mir1-CP was capable of permeabilizing the PM. The present study used both targeted (qRT-PCR) and global (mRNA-seq) transcriptome analyses to explore the effect of eating Mir1-CP expressing Mp708 maize on abundance of transcripts in the MG of fall armyworm larvae in comparison to MGs from larvae fed on susceptible Tx601 maize that does not express Mir1-CP.  Expression of genes encoding proteins involved in PM production is upregulated in MGs from fall armyworm fed on Mp708.  Also, several digestive enzymes (endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, lipases, amylase) were more highly expressed in MGs from larvae fed on Mp708 than MGs from larvae fed on Tx601.  Impaired growth of larvae fed on Mp708 probably results from metabolic costs associated with higher production of PM constituents and digestive enzymes in a compensatory attempt to maintain MG function. Overall design: Beginning as neonates, fall armyworm larvae used in the mRNA-seq experiment were reared on yellow-green midwhorl foliage from resistant Mp708 maize or susceptible Tx601 maize.  Old foliage and frass were removed every other day and replaced with fresh foliage.  Larvae were reared in an environmental chamber at 27Ã‚Â°C, 14:10 (light:dark) photoperiod, and 70% relative humidity.

After removing Malpighian tubules, foregut anterior to the stomodial valve, hindgut and food bolus, the MG was transferred from the body cavity, rinsed well with cold saline, and preserved in RNAlaterÃ‚Â®.  Equal amounts (3 Ã‚Âµg) of total RNA from an individual MG were randomly pooled into three replicates per treatment (i.e., Mp708 or Tx601) such that each treatment replicate derived from 12-13 MGs.  Each pool of total RNA was separately enriched for poly(A+) RNA and submitted to the Penn State Genomics Core Facility (University Park, PA) where barcoded cDNA libraries were prepared and equimolar quantities of each library sequenced on the SOLiD 3 Plus System.

However, the evolutionary path from a neocentromere to a mature centromere has been elusive. Here we analyzed the centromeres of six chromosomes that were transferred from maize into oat as the result of an inter-species cross. Centromere size and location were assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation for the histone variant CENH3, which is a defining feature of functional centromeres. Maize and oat are highly divergent and differ in genome size by four fold. Two isolates of maize chromosome proved to contain neocentromeres in the sense that they had moved from the original site, whereas the remaining seven centromeres (1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10) were retained in the same area in both species. In all cases the CENH3-binding domains were dramatically expanded to encompass a larger area in the oat background (~4 Mb) than the average centromere size in maize (~2 Mb). The expansion of maize centromeres appeared to be restricted by the transcription of genes located in regions flanking the original centromeres. The results from the current study provide evidence that (1) centromere size is regulated; (2) centromere sizes tend to be uniform within a species regardless of chromosome size or origin of the centromere; and (3) neocentromeres emerge and expand preferentially in gene poor regions. Our results, together with data from several animal species, suggest that centromere size expansion may be a key factor in the survival of neocentric chromosomes in natural populations.

Kranz anatomy is characterized by closely spaced veins that are encircled by two morphologically distinct photosynthetic cell types. Although Kranz anatomy evolved multiple times, the underlying genetic mechanisms remain largely elusive, with only the maize scarecrow gene so far implicated in Kranz patterning. To provide a broader insight into the regulation of Kranz differentiation, we performed a genome-wide comparative analysis of developmental trajectories in Kranz (foliar leaf blade) and non-Kranz (husk leaf sheath) leaves of the C4 plant maize. Using profile classifica- tion of gene expression in early leaf primordia, we identified cohorts of genes associated with procam- bium initiation and vascular patterning. In addition, we used supervised classification criteria inferred from anatomical and developmental analyses of five developmental stages to identify candidate regula- tors of cell-type specification. Our analysis supports the suggestion that Kranz anatomy is patterned, at least in part, by a SCARECROW/SHORTROOT regulatory network, and suggests likely components of that network.

The methyltransferase HEN1 stabilizes plant miRNAs, animal piRNAs, and siRNAs in both kingdoms via 3' terminal methylation. Loss of HEN1 in plants results in non-templated oligo-uridylation and accelerated degradation of miRNAs. In hen1 mutants from Arabidopsis and rice, we found that the patterns of miRNA truncation and uridylation differ substantially among miRNA families, but such patterns for the same miRNA are conserved between species. miR166 and miR163 are truncated predominantly to ~17 and ~16 nt, and subsequently recover via uridylation to approximately their original sizes, 21 and 24 nt, suggesting that in these cases miRNA truncation triggers uridylation. miR171 is untruncated but uridylated to 22 nt in hen1 mutants, gaining the ability to trigger production of phased, secondary siRNAs. Truncated and tailed variants were bound by ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) in hen1, implying that these events occur while miRNAs are still bound by AGO1. Unexpectedly, a portion of miR158 in wildtype remains unmethylated and thus subject to uridylation and destabilization, suggesting that plants naturally utilize miRNA methylation to modulate miRNA accumulation. Our results suggest that the AGO1-containing RISC complex may undergo programming to reflect each bound miRNA, determining a defined, distinct decay destiny. Overall design: In this analysis, we sequenced sRNAs from two hen1 mutant alleles in Arabidopsis and three hen1 alleles in rice. In Arabidopsis, the strong hen1-1 allele in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype is the first hen1 mutant and emerged from an enhancer screen in the hua1-1/hua2-1 background, and hen1-8 in the Columbia (Col) background is a weak allele. In rice, WAVY LEAF1 (WAF1) is the ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, and two mutant alleles waf1-1 and waf1-2 each bear a single-base substitution leading to a premature stop codon in the second exon and a non-functional splicing site of the fourth intron, respectively.

We used Illumina sequencing to assess how sRNA populations vary between two maize inbred lines (B73, Mo17) and their hybrid. We sampled sRNAs from the seedling shoot apex and the developing ear, two rapidly growing tissues that program the greater growth of maize hybrids. We found that parental differences in siRNAs primarily originate from repeat regions. Although the maize genome contains greater number and complexity of repeats compared to Arabidopsis or rice, we confirmed that like these simpler plant genomes, 24-nt siRNAs whose abundance differs between maize parents also show a trend of downregulation following hybridization. Surprisingly, hybrid vigor is fully maintained when 24-nt siRNAs are globally reduced by mutation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase2 (RDR2) encoded by modifier of paramutation1 (mop1). We also discovered that 21-22nt siRNAs derived from a number of distinct retrotransposon families differentially accumulate between B73 and Mo17 as well as their hybrid. Thus, maize possesses a novel source of genetic variation for regulating both transposons and genes at a genomic scale, which may contribute to its high degree of observed heterosis. Overall design: sRNA libraries were derived from RNA isolated from the seedling shoot apex and developing ear tissues from B73, Mo17, B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73. The shoot apex was chosen because it is enriched for meristematic tissue where cell proliferation occurs, rates of organ initiation are determined, and organ size is specified. The developing ear was examined because it is enriched in meristematic tissue and is undergoing rapid growth, and also because the mature ear shows the highest degree of heterosis. Total RNA was isolated and separated on a 15% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel. Using a 10-bp ladder, the sRNA fraction representing 10-40-bp was excised. sRNA libraries were prepared according to Lu et al. (2007) or manufacturer's instructitions (Illumina). A combination of Perl scripts and FASTX toolkit scripts were used to remove adapters, collapse identical sequences and count reads per sequence.

We have developed a modification of BSA (BSR-Seq) that makes use of RNA-Seq reads to efficiently map genes even in populations for which no polymorphic markers have been previously identified. Because of the digital nature of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, it is possible to conduct de novo SNP discovery and quantitatively genotype BSA samples using the same RNA-Seq data. In addition, analysis of the RNA-Seq data provides information on the effects of the mutant on global patterns of gene expression at no extra cost.  In combination these results greatly simplify gene cloning experiments.      To demonstrate the utility of this strategy BSR-Seq was used to clone the glossy3 (gl3) gene of maize. Mutants of the glossy loci exhibit altered accumulation of epicuticular waxes on juvenile leaves.  We previously generated a large collection of glossy mutants using the Mu transposon system.  By subjected a reference allele to BSR-Seq, we were able to map the gl3 locus to a ~2.3Mb interval that is consistent with the results of prior mapping experiments. The single gene located in the 2.3Mb mapping interval that contained a Mu insertion and whose expression was down-regulated in the mutant pool was subsequently demonstrated to be the gl3 gene via the analysis of multiple independently Mu transposon induced mutant alleles.

For SNP discovery approaches using short read lengths that next-generation DNA sequencing technologies offer, the highly repetitive and duplicated nature of large plant genomes presents additional challenges.  Here, we describe a genomic library construction procedure that facilitates pyrosequencing of genic and low-copy regions in plant genomes, and a customized computational pipeline to analyze and assemble short reads (100-200 bp), identify allelic reference sequence comparisons, and call SNPs with a high degree of accuracy.

To characterize the involvement of miRNAs in response to hypoxia conditions, a quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT-PCR) assay was used to profile the expression changes of the 22 candidate mature miRNAs, which were selected from small RNA library of waterlogging resistant line Hz32 and 84 of their predicted targets in three inbred Zea mays lines that showed different tolerance to waterlogging.

TAIL-PCR products were amplified from 24 pools of 12 lines arranged in a 12 x 12 grid (Settles et al, 2004). The products were sequenced on GS-FLX 454 platform using custom adapter primers that gave directional reads from the transposon end as well as a 4 bp molecular bar code.","Approximately 85% of the reads correspond to bona fide transposon flanking sequence tags (FSTs). These FSTs have 31 bp at the start of each read with the following structure:  1) 4 bp barcode  2) 21 bp Mutator terminal inverted repeat primer (5'-ctcttcKtcYataatggcaat-3')  3) 6 bp of the Mutator element (5'-TATCTC-3')    The barcodes for each pool are as follows:  Row A CGAT  Row B CGTA  Row C CTAG  Row D CTGA  Row E TACG  Row F TCAG  Row G TCGA  Row H TCGT  Row I TCTG  Row J TGAG  Row K TGCA  Row L TGCT  Column 01 ACAG  Column 02 ACGA  Column 03 ACGT  Column 04 ACTG  Column 05 AGCA  Column 06 AGCT  Column 07 AGTG  Column 08 ATCG  Column 09 CACT  Column 10 CAGA  Column 11 CAGT  Column 12 CATG"

Most capture protocols require blocking DNA, the production of which in large quantities can prove challenging. A blocker-free, two-stage capture protocol was developed using NimbleGen arrays. The first capture depletes the library of repetitive sequences, while the second enriches for target loci. This strategy was used to resequence non-repetitive portions of an approximately 2.2 Mb chromosomal interval and a set of 43 genes dispersed in the 2.3 Gb maize genome. This approach achieved approximately 1800-3000-fold enrichment and 80-98% coverage of targeted bases. More than 2500 SNPs were identified in target genes. Low rates of false-positive SNP predictions were obtained, even in the presence of captured paralogous sequences. Importantly, it was possible to recover novel sequences from non-reference alleles. The ability to design novel repeat-subtraction and target capture arrays makes this technology accessible in any species.",NA

The approximately one dozen distinct Mu transposons contain highly similar ~215 bp Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and generate 9-bp Target Site Duplications (TSDs) upon insertion. Using a novel chromosome walking strategy that uses these conserved TIRs as primer binding sites, Mu insertion sites were amplified from Mu stocks and sequenced via the 454 FLX platform.","DLA, a genome walking method, was adapted for sequencing Mu flanking sequences using the 454 FLX platform.  Mu flanking sequences from different Mu lines were amplified by a genome walking method, DLA (Liu et al., Genetics, Submitted) and pooled for the 454 pyrosequencing. The primers used to construct the DNA library are composite primers. DNA barcodes (6 bp) were inserted between the 454 primer A and the Mu-specific primer to allow different input samples that were pooled in the same 454 run to be distinguished after sequencing. The resulting library amplified with Primer 1 and Primer 2 was subjected to 454 sequencing using 454 primer A. Totally, Gl2 and Mu2 samples were subjected to sequencing. Each experiences two technical replication. Each replication was run in the half plate."
