DNA affinity purification sequencing (DAP-seq), which uses affinity-purified transcription factors (TFs) to capture genomic DNA fragments, was applied to all 1,725 Arabidopsis thaliana TFs. High confidence TFBS motifs for 529 TFs and genome-wide enrichment maps for 349 factors were identified. In total,~ 2.7 million TFBS were identified which predict thousands of TF target genes enriched for known and novel functions.. Comparison of TF-binding using cytosine-methylated and -unmethylated genomic DNA revealed a 2-50 fold inhibition at methylated motifs for ~82% (264) of factors tested while 4.6% (15) showed stronger binding to methylated motifs. Finally, we describe how binding of Arabidopsis and maize Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) at phased motif repeats is highly enriched at ARF target gene promoters and how this architecture may allow for stabilization of dimers/multimers. Overall design: Identification of sequence motifs for 530 transcription factors (529 Arabidopsis thaliana, 1 Zea mays) and genome-wide binding sites for 350 transcription factors (349 Arabidopsis thaliana, 1 Zea mays) by direct sequencing of affinity purified genomic DNA fragments.

To explore global expression patterns and dissect the underlying genetic mechanisms are important scientific inquires which are still largely unknown, especially between a segregating population and the parents. In our study, we used RNA-Seq to profile the shoot apex transcriptome variation (including protein coding genes and non-coding genes) in maize IBM RIL population, to map eQTLs underlying the transcriptome variations and to utilize eQTLs to clone genes involved in maize shoot apices development. We revealed that: Much of the variation (the population mean, the coefficient of variation) of gene expression levels in RILs is reflective of differences present among the parents; These transcriptome variations could be explained by 30,774 eQTLs with 96 trans-eQTL hotspots; In many cases, the genes commonly regulated by a trans-eQTL hotspot are enriched for a specific function or act in the same genetic pathway; Structural variation within and near genes contributs to cis-regulatory variation. All of these results indicate Mendelian factors play as major contributors to the transcriptome variation. Meanwhile, non-Mendelian regulations were also observed as paramutation-like expression pattern for 145 genes, of which 88% genes were predicted to be potential targets of miRNAs or ta-siRNAs, and as unexpected presence/absence expression patterns for 210 genes.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

However, the regulatory network that controls leaf development remains poorly understood. To tackle this issue, several leaf transcriptomic studies have been conducted. These studies have identified genes differentially expressed between mesophyll and bundle sheath cells or between different regions of a leaf. They have also provided a global picture of the transcriptional dynamics of genes in developing leaves during seed germination. Moreover, one study has identified cohorts of genes associated with procambium initiation and vascular patterning. In the present and a previous study, we have obtained 22 transcriptomes with a time span from hour 0 (dry seeds) to hour 192 post imbibition. Using these time series data, we studied gene up- and down-regulation and functional transition during leaf development, and we inferred 30 sets of strongly coexpressed genes, which showed different functional enrichments. More significantly, we developed methods to predict TF binding sites (TFBSs) and their cognate TFs. In addition, for a TF-TFBS pair known in one species, we developed a method to predict its orthologous TF-TFBS pair in another species. From these efforts, we predicted 1,459 TFBSs and 250 TF-TFBS pairs in the maize genome. Experimental tests of our predicted TF-TFBS pairs showed that our methods perform well.

One proposed approach was to sequence individual BAC clones from a tiling path defined by combining genetic and physical mapping. Another focused on the non-repetitive (gene-rich) sequences while a third examined the most cost-effective method to determine the nucleotide sequence for the entire genome by examining a small portion. The National Science Foundation funded three sequencing projects in maize that tested the sequencing strategies for large plant genomes, using maize as an example.  The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=9872655>first </a> project funded under the NSF Plant Genome Initiative, toward genetic and physical mapping, was awarded to Ed Coe and colleagues at the University of Missouri along with Rod Wing of the University of Arizona and Andrew Paterson of the University of Georgia.  The question under test for maize was whether fingerprinted BACs could be assembled into contigs and pseudochromosomes. By combining genetic and physical strategies they derived a high-resolution genetic map; constructed and fingerprinted 450,000 BACs and assembled them into contigs; and anchored assemblies onto the genetic map, integrating the physical elements in genetic map order. These data and materials were staged for subsequent selection of a minimum tiling path and BAC-by-BAC sequencing, once the feasibility of this approach was demonstrated.   The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0221536>test project for non-repetitive sequences</a> was awarded to the Consortium for Maize Genomics. They tested two strategies, <b>methyl-filtration</b> and <b>high-Cot selection</b>, as a method to exclude repetitive DNA from the input to sequencing. The consortium members are The Donald Danforth Plant Science Center, TIGR, Purdue University, and Orion Genomics. The underlying premise is that knowing the nucleotide sequence of the gene-space will be sufficient.  The <a href=https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=0211851>test project for sequencing and examining a portion of the genome</a> was awarded to Jo Messing at Rutgers University  along with Rod Wing and Cari Soderlund from the University of Arizona. They proposed to use a modified BAC-by-BAC sequencing strategy. They have sequenced about 20 Mb of the maize genome represented in 140 BAC clones. Sequencing was carried out at  the Whitehead Institute/MIT Center for Genome Research.  The Arizona Genomics Institute has sequenced about 450,000 BAC ends which aid in aligning BAC sequences to the genetic map using co-linearity of these sequences with the rice genomic sequence. Also a FPC map was produced by the Arizona Genomics Institute.

Uncovering the intriguing nature of the DG, i.e. its composition, origin and function, represents a step forward towards an understanding of the processes generating genetic diversity and phenotypic variation.

The TSSM is an extreme generalist documented to feed on more than 1100 plant hosts. In contrast, the BGM is a grass specialist, with hosts including important cereal crops like maize, wheat, sorghum and barley. Historically, studies of plant-herbivore interactions have focused largely on insects. However, far less is known about plant responses to spider mite herbivores, especially in grasses, and whether responses differ between generalists and specialists. To identify plant defense pathways responding to spider mites, we collected time course RNA-seq data from barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) infested with TSSMs and BGMs. Additionally, and as a comparison to the physical damage caused by spider mite feeding, a wounding treatment was also included. Overall design: The experiment was performed with four biological replicates across each of the following (28 samples in total): no infestation (C, control), 2hr after wounding (W2), 24hr after wounding (W24), 2hr after TSSM infestation (T2), 24hr after TSSM infestation (T24), 2hr after BGM infestation (B2), and 24hr after BGM infestation (B24).",NA,"2016"

ZmCCA1b binds to over 4,300 target genes in the maize genomes, of which annotation confirms energy metabolic pathways as the main output. We report that an altered temporal binding activity of ZmCCA1b in the hybrid seedlings, which increases expression of carbon fixation genes, increases carbon fixation rates and biomass, demonstrating a novel example of how circadian-regulatory networks directly contribute to growth vigor in maize hybrids. These results collectively offer new insights into clock-mediated regulation of growth vigor in hybrid plants and crops.

The examination of maize genes and conserved non-coding sequences reveals that many of these are flanked by regions of elevated asymmetric CHH (where H is any base except G) methylation. These mCHH islands are quite short (~100bp) and are enriched near active genes. The analysis of DNA methylation in other sequence contexts and several chromatin modifications reveal that the mCHH island marks the transition from heterochromatin associated modifications to euchromatin associated modifications. The mCHH island often occurs at the edge of the transposon that is located nearest to the gene. The presence of a mCHH island is fairly consistent in several distinct tissues that were surveyed but shows some variation among different haplotypes. The presence of InDels in promoters often influences the presence and position of the mCHH island. The mCHH islands are dependent upon RNA-directed DNA methylation activities. The mCHH islands are lost in the mop1 and mop3 mutants but the nearby genes do not necessarily exhibit altered expression levels. Instead, the loss of the mCHH island often results in the erosion of heterochromatic marks into the nearby transposon. This suggests that mCHH islands and RNA-directed DNA methylation near maize genes may act to preserve the silencing of transposons from activity of the genes.",NA,"2015"

A collection of mutant alleles for 11 maize genes predicted to play roles in controlling DNA methylation were isolated through forward- or reverse-genetics approaches. Low-coverage whole genome bisulfite sequencing and high-coverage sequence-capture bisulfite sequencing were applied to mutant lines to determine context- and locus-specific effects of these mutations on DNA methylation profiles. Plants containing mutant alleles for components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway exhibit loss of CHH methylation at many loci as well as CG and CHG methylation at a small number of loci. Those loci tend to have elevated CHH levels in wild-type plants relative to the average of genome-wide value, and are enriched for 21-nt to 24-nt small RNAs. Plants containing loss-of-function alleles for chromomethylase (CMT) genes exhibit strong genome-wide reductions in CHG methylation and some locus-specific loss of CHH methylation. There is evidence for two pathways mediating CHH methylation in maize with the RdDM pathway influencing CHH levels in regions near genes and in short length transposons, while an ortholog of the Arabidopsis CMT3 mediated pathway plays a role in CHH methylation present in long transposons, similar to the role played by CMT2 in Arabidopsis. In an attempt to identify stocks with stronger reductions in DNA methylation levels than provided by single gene mutations, we performed crosses to create double mutants for the maize CMT3 orthologs, Zmet2 and Zmet5, and for the maize DDM1 orthologs, Chr101 and Chr106. While loss-of-function alleles are viable as single gene mutants, the double mutants were not recovered, suggesting that severe perturbations of the maize methylome may have stronger deleterious phenotypic effects than in Arabidopsis.",NA,"2015"

The recently developed Hi-C technology is an efficacious method to investigate genome packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intra-chromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions and which represent a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction and they are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1 and H3.3. We also identify over 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not the dominant feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found over 1,000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions similar to the interior of TADs. These insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions show strong enrichment for distinct epigenetic marks, and correlate with gene transcription levels. We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity all contribute to shaping the local structure of the A. thaliana nuclear genome.",NA,"2014"

The auricles act as a hinge, allowing the leaf blade to project at an angle from the stem, while the ligule comprises an epidermally-derived fringe. Recessive liguleless1 mutants lack ligules and auricles, and have upright leaves. We utilized laser-microdissection RNAseq to identify genes that are differentially expressed along discrete cell/tissue-specific domains along the proximal-distal axis of wild-type leaf primordia undergoing ligule initiation, and compared transcript accumulation in wild type and liguleless1 mutant leaf primordia. We identified transcripts that are specifically upregulated at the blade-sheath boundary. A surprising number of these ligule genes are also implicated to function during leaf initiation or lateral branching, and intersect multiple hormonal signalling pathways. We propose that genetic modules utilised in leaf and/or branch initiation are redeployed to regulate ligule outgrowth from leaf primordia. Overall design: In this study, we analysed the transcriptome associated with ligule formation using laser microdissection RNA-sequencing (LM-RNAseq). We quantified transcript accumulation in the PLB and adjacent pre-blade and pre-sheath regions of wild-type leaf primordia in order to identify candidate genes involved in proximal-distal patterning at the blade-sheath boundary. We also compared transcript accumulation in lg1-R mutants and wild-type siblings to identity genes acting downstream of LG1.",NA,"2014"

Deep sequencing of RNAs isolated from 14 days after pollination maize endosperm and embryo tissue was used to identify imprinted genes in a set of ~12,000 genes that were expressed and contained sequence polymorphisms in the B73 and Mo17 genotypes.  The analysis of parent-of-origin patterns of expression resulted in the identification of 100 putative imprinted genes in maize endosperm including 54 maternally expressed genes (MEGs) and 46 paternally expressed genes (PEGs).  Three of these genes have been previously identified as imprinted while the remaining 97 genes represent novel imprinted maize genes.  The 100 imprinted genes are distributed throughout the maize genome with little evidence for any clustering.  A genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation identified regions with reduced endosperm DNA methylation in, or near, 19 of the 100 imprinted genes.  The reduced levels of DNA methylation in endosperm are caused by specific hypomethylation of the maternal allele for both MEGs and PEGs in all cases tested.  Many of the imprinted genes with reduced DNA methylation levels also show endosperm-specific expression patterns.  The imprinted maize genes were compared with imprinted genes identified in genome-wide screens of rice and Arabidopsis and at least 10 examples of conserved imprinting between maize and each of the other species were identified.  The genes that are imprinted in multiple species may provide insights into the conserved functions of imprinting.","The data presented here contains the RNA-seq reads used in the analysis for this manuscript. There are three biological replicates of two tissues (endosperm and embryo) in two different maize genotypes (B73 and Mo17) for a total of 12 RNA-seq samples.

Natural sources of resistance from maize genotypes are used in conventional breeding approaches, but the signals and effectors involved in resistance in this important crop species are not well understood. Early transcriptional changes associated with F. verticillioides infection were analysed in resistant CO441 and susceptible CO354 maize genotypes using RNA-Sequencing technology. Transcript level were measured at 72 hours post-inoculation (hpi), reflecting the time point immediately preceding the onset of resistance in CO441, as determined by the absolute quantification of the fungal ÃƒÅ¸-tubulin2 gene. More than 100 million sequence reads were generated for condition (inoculated/uninoculated). The sequence reads were analyzed to measure gene expression levels and determine single nucleotide polymorphisms. We observed 2,551 transcripts with statistically significant differential expression before inoculation by comparing uninoculated control samples. Overall, a more induced expression of genes distributed in all functional classes is found in the CO441 genotype, in particular a high percentage of differentially genes were more expressed only in the resistant genotype for the functional class secondary metabolism. Furthermore, a total of 2,250 and 2,442 transcripts were differentially regulated after F. verticillioides inoculation in resistant and susceptible genotypes, respectively. The genes in common were 1,028 genes and showed 5,342 SNPs variants, suggesting a certain variability in the defense responses of the two genotypes. Also at 72 hpi, secondary metabolism was the category where the most interesting differences between the two genotypes were observed to a greater extent. Pathways related to phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan biosynthesis (e.g. anthranilate synthase, shikimate kinase), flavonoid biosynthesis (e.g. chalcone synthase) and lignin biosynthesis (e.g. cinnamyl-alcohol dehydrogenase) appeared to be strongly influenced by infection in the CO441 genotype with up to 11-fold induction. Response to stress and resistance categories followed. In addition, transcriptional modulation affected signal transduction, including calcium signaling, ethylene signaling, MAP kinases, receptor-like kinases, and numerous transcription factors. Even though all these genes were well represented in both genotypes, it was observed that on the whole CO441 mounts a stronger gene induction, confirming its strengthening also in the specific response to inoculation. The identification of plant candidate resistance genes that interact with fungus could be exploited in future biotechnological approaches to increase disease resistance in susceptible maize genotypes.",NA,"2014"

The goal of this project is to test the hypothesis that differences in gene copy number (both gains and losses) contribute to the extraordinary phenotypic diversity and plasticity of maize. Maize is a good model for these studies because it exhibits a rapid decay of linkage disequilibrium (LD) and because a draft genome sequence of the B73 inbred and mapping populations are available.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element.

Recent comparisons of small RNA (sRNA) profiles from parents and their heterotic progeny identified correlations between interparental 24-nucleotide (24-nt) RNA variation and non-additive 24-nt RNA changes in the resulting hybrid [2,3].  24-nt RNAs guide de novo cytosine methylation, and several proteins are required for their biogenesis, including a Snf2-like ATPase: required to maintain repression1 (RMR1) [4].  We found height variation between heterotic hybrids +/- RMR1 activity, implicating a role for RMR1 in heterosis.  Based on the published correlations mentioned above [2,3], we hypothesized that RMR1-loss reduces parental sRNAs, altering their relative ratios and changing the sRNA profiles in the resulting hybrid from those of a standard hybrid (from +RMR1 parents).  To probe this hypothesis, we profiled sRNAs from parents and hybrids +/- RMR1 function, limiting the parental diversity to only portions of chromosomes 6 and 9.  Our analysis will address how RMR1 loss changes hybrid sRNAs in the presence and absence of underlying genetic variation and help to determine how this loss results in different phenotypic outcomes from heterotic crosses. 1.

Differential gene expression analyses and network-based methods were used to identify gene modules transcriptionally correlated with the RR phenotype.

Overall design: We profiled changes in gene expression during normal maize ear and tassel development and in developing maize ear primordia upon genetic perturbation of the RAMOSA branching pathway.  For the wild-type ear and tassel developmental series, greenhouse-grown B73 inbred plants were used.  10mm ears were collected and sectioned as follows from tip to base along the developmental gradient: tip 1mm sampled (tip; Inflorescence Meristem/Spikelet Pair Meristem), next 1mm discarded, next 1mm sampled (mid; Spikelet Meristem), next 2mm discarded, next 2 mm sampled (base; Floral Meristem), and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.

Here we report on a maize GWAS that identified TASs underlying five quantitative traits measured across a large panel of samples and examine the characteristics of these TASs. A set of SNPs obtained via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), most of which are located within annotated genes (~87%) were complemented with additional SNPs from the maize HapMap Project that contains approximately equal proportions of intragenic and intergenic SNPs. TASs were identified via a genome scan while controlling for polygenic background effects. The diverse functions of TAS-containing candidate genes indicate that complex genetic networks shape these traits. The vast majority of the TAS-containing candidate genes have dynamic expression levels among developmental stages. Overall, TASs explain 44~54% of the total phenotypic variation for these traits, with equal contributions from intra- and inter-genic TASs. Association of ligueless2 with upper leaf angle was implicated by two intragenic TASs; rough sheath1 was associated with leaf width by an upstream intergenic TAS; and Zea agamous5 was associated with days to silking by both intra- and inter-genic TASs. A large proportion (82%) of these TASs comes from noncoding regions, similar to findings from human diseases and traits.

Despite their importance for plant development, the genomic network targeted by KNOX proteins is poorly understood. Using ChIP-seq, we defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci. To understand how these binding occupancies correlate with changes in transcriptional regulation, we performed RNA-seq on immature ears and tassels, and compared expression profiles between normal and loss-of-function kn1 plants, in addition to immature leaves from normal and gain-of-function Kn1 plants. We found that 643 of the KN1 targets were modulated in one or multiple tissues, with a strong enrichment for transcription factors (including other homeobox genes) and genes participating in several hormonal pathways, most significantly auxin, implicating KN1 at the crossroads of plant hormone signaling. The loss-of-function kn1 phenotype is reminiscent of auxin mutants and kn1 mis-expression in leaves correlates with increased auxin signaling. Our results demonstrate that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant meristem identity and function.

To define key innovations in C4 photosynthesis, we profiled metabolites and gene expression along a developing leaf gradient. A novel statistical method was implemented to compare transcriptomes from these two species along a unified leaf developmental gradient and define candidate cis-regulatory elements and transcription factors driving photosynthetic gene expression. We also present comparative primary and secondary metabolic profiles along the gradients that provide new insight into nitrogen and carbon metabolism in C3 and C4 grasses. The power of this comparative approach is illustrated by defining an aerial suberin biosynthetic pathway for maize and identifying transcriptional regulators of suberin biosynthesis, a novel innovation associated with C4 photosynthesis.

RM55-rm is homozygous for a mutable allele (rm) that specifies black and brown striped seeds; RM30-R* is a stable black revertant isoline derived from the mutable line; and RM38-r has brown seed coats due to a recessive r allele shown to translate a truncated MYB protein. Using long range PCR, 454 sequencing of amplicons, and whole genome re-sequencing, we determined that the variegated  RM55-rm line had a 13 kb CACTA subfamily transposon insertion (designated TgmR*) at a position 110 bp from the beginning of Intron2 of the R locus, Glyma09g36983. Although the MYB encoded by R was expressed at only very low levels in older seed coats of the black revertant RM30-R* line, it upregulated expression of anthocyanidin synthase genes (ANS2, ANS3) to promote the synthesis of anthocyanins. Surprisingly, the RM30-R* revertant also carried the 13 kb TgmR* insertion in Intron2. Using RNA-Seq, we showed that intron splicing was accurate, albeit at lower levels, despite the presence of the 13kb TgmR* element. As determined by whole genome methylation sequencing, we demonstrate that the TgmR* sequence was relatively more methylated in RM30-R* than in the mutable RM55-rm progenitor line. The stabilized and more methylated RM30-R* revertant line apparently lacks effective binding of a transposae to its subterminal repeats, thus allowing intron splicing to proceed resulting in sufficient MYB protein to stimulate anthocyanin production and thus black seed coats. In this regard, the TgmR* element in soybean resembles McClintockÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s Spm-suppressible and change-of-state alleles of maize. This comparison explains the opposite effects of the TgmR* element on intron splicing of the MYB gene in which it resides depending on the methylation state of the element.

We observed that whereas histone modifications vary both between tissues and between genotypes, DNA methylation patterns are more distinguishable between genotypes than between tissues. Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between tissues and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements (TEs), and for different TEs in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species.

Here we studied the organization of TEs within the maize (Zea mays ssp mays) genome, documenting that TEs fall within three groups based on the class and copy numbers.

To assay how pbf1 affects phenotypic differences between maize and teosinte, we compared isogenic lines (NILs) that differ for a maize vs.and teosinte alleles of pbf1. Kernel weight for the teosinte NIL (162 mg) is slightly and significantly greater than that for the maize NIL (156 mg). RNAseq data for developing kernels show that the teosinte allele of pbf1 is expressed at about twice the level of the maize allele. However, RNA and protein assays showed no difference in zein profiles between the two NILs. The lower expression for the maize pbf1 allele suggests that selection may have favored this change, however, how reduced pbf1 expression alters phenotype remains unknown. One possibility is that pbf1 regulates genes other than zeins and thereby a domestication trait. The observed drop in seed weight associated with the maize allele of pbf1 is counterintuitive, but could represent a negative pleiotropic effect of selection on some other aspect of kernel composition.",NA,"2014"

The phenotypes conditioned by mutation of lbl1 and SGS3 are, however, strikingly different, suggesting that the activities of these small RNA biogenesis components, or the tasiRNAs and their targets might not be entirely conserved. To investigate the basis for this phenotypic variation, we compared the small RNA content between wild-type and lbl1 seedling apices. We show that LBL1 affects all major classes of small RNAs, and reveal unexpected crosstalk between tasiRNA biogenesis and other small RNA pathways regulating miRNAs, retrotransposons, and DNA transposons. We further identified genomic regions generating phased siRNAs, including numerous loci generating 22-nt phased small RNAs from long hairpin RNAs or overlapping antisense transcripts not previously described in other plant species. By combining both analyses, we identified nine TAS loci, all belonging to the conserved TAS3 family. Contrary to other plant species, no TAS loci targeted by a single miRNA were identified. Information from target prediction, RNAseq, and PARE analyses identified the tasiARFs as the major functional tasiRNAs in the maize vegetative apex where they regulate expression of ARF3 homologs. As such, divergence in TAS pathways is unlikely to account for the distinct phenotypes of tasiRNA biogenesis mutants in Arabidopsis and maize. Instead, the data suggests variation in the spatiotemporal regulation of ARF3, or divergence in its function, as a plausible basis for the dramatic phenotypic differences observed upon mutation of SGS3/lbl1 in Arabidopsis and maize.

Resistant Mp708 thwarts feeding by fall armyworm (Spodoptera frugiperda [J.E. Smith]; Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), numerous other lepidopteran pests, and the coleopteran western corn rootworm.  This broad resistance makes it an excellent model for studying native host plant resistance mechanisms.  In response to caterpillar feeding, Mp708 rapidly mobilizes Mir1-CP, a unique cysteine protease that appears to translocate from roots to the maize midwhorl where it accumulates.  This accumulation correlates with a significant reduction in caterpillar growth resulting from diminished food utilization.  In addition, the peritrophic membrane (PM) that surrounds the food bolus in the mudgut (MG) is severely damaged in caterpillars fed on sweet corn callus transformed to express the gene encoding Mir1-CP or on midwhorl tissue from resistant Mp708 maize.  Functions of the PM include assisting digestion and protecting the epithelium of the caterpillar MG from physical and chemical damage.  Consequently, the reduced growth of caterpillars that feed on Mp708 is probably due to the action of Mir1-CP on PM physiology. In fact, previous in vitro studies indicated that Mir1-CP was capable of permeabilizing the PM. The present study used both targeted (qRT-PCR) and global (mRNA-seq) transcriptome analyses to explore the effect of eating Mir1-CP expressing Mp708 maize on abundance of transcripts in the MG of fall armyworm larvae in comparison to MGs from larvae fed on susceptible Tx601 maize that does not express Mir1-CP.  Expression of genes encoding proteins involved in PM production is upregulated in MGs from fall armyworm fed on Mp708.  Also, several digestive enzymes (endopeptidases, aminopeptidases, lipases, amylase) were more highly expressed in MGs from larvae fed on Mp708 than MGs from larvae fed on Tx601.  Impaired growth of larvae fed on Mp708 probably results from metabolic costs associated with higher production of PM constituents and digestive enzymes in a compensatory attempt to maintain MG function. Overall design: Beginning as neonates, fall armyworm larvae used in the mRNA-seq experiment were reared on yellow-green midwhorl foliage from resistant Mp708 maize or susceptible Tx601 maize.  Old foliage and frass were removed every other day and replaced with fresh foliage.  Larvae were reared in an environmental chamber at 27Ã‚Â°C, 14:10 (light:dark) photoperiod, and 70% relative humidity.  Midguts were dissected from larvae 2 d after molting to the last instar with masses between 300 and 400 mg.  Dissections were done with cold anesthetized larvae submerged in Bombyx saline.  After removing Malpighian tubules, foregut anterior to the stomodial valve, hindgut and food bolus, the MG was transferred from the body cavity, rinsed well with cold saline, and preserved in RNAlaterÃ‚Â®.  Equal amounts (3 Ã‚Âµg) of total RNA from an individual MG were randomly pooled into three replicates per treatment (i.e., Mp708 or Tx601) such that each treatment replicate derived from 12-13 MGs.  Each pool of total RNA was separately enriched for poly(A+) RNA and submitted to the Penn State Genomics Core Facility (University Park, PA) where barcoded cDNA libraries were prepared and equimolar quantities of each library sequenced on the SOLiD 3 Plus System.

Plant DICER-LIKE4 (DCL4) performs dual functions, acting in antiviral defense, as well as in development via the biogenesis of tasiR-ARFs. These small RNAs play an essential role in the grasses and act to spatially define the expression domain of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3) transcription factors. However, contrary to tasiR-ARFsÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ essential function in development, DCL4 proteins exhibit strong evidence of recurrent adaptation typical of host factors involved in antiviral immunity. Here, we address how DCL4 balances its role in development with pressures to diversify in response to viral attack. We show that, in contrast to other tasiR-ARF biogenesis mutants, dcl4 null alleles condition an uncharacteristically mild phenotype, correlated with normal expression of select arf3 targets. Loss of DCL4 activity yields a class of 22-nt tasiR-ARF variants associated with the processing of arf3 transcripts into 22-nt secondary siRNAs by DCL1. Our findings uncover the presence of a novel DCL1-dependent siRNA pathway that bypasses the otherwise adverse developmental effects of DCL4 mutations. This novel pathway is predicted to have important implications for DCL4Ã¢â‚¬â„¢s role in antiviral defense by reducing the selective constraints on DCL4 and allowing it to diversify in response to viral suppressors.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the development and adaptation of plants to the environment. In this study, the spatio-temporal miRNA transcript profiling of the maize inbred line Q319 root and leaf in response to low Pi was analyzed with high-throughput sequencing technologies, and the expression patterns of certain target genes were detected by real-time RT-PCR. Complex small RNA populations were detected after low-Pi culture and displayed different patterns in the root and leaf. miRNAs identified as responding to Pi deficiency can be grouped into Ã¢â‚¬ËœearlyÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ miRNAs that respond rapidly, and often non-specifically, to Pi deficiency, and Ã¢â‚¬ËœlateÃ¢â‚¬â„¢ miRNAs that alter the morphology, physiology or metabolism of plants upon prolonged Pi deficiency. The miR827-Nitrogen limitation adaptation (NLA)-mediated post-transcriptional pathway was conserved in response to Pi availability of maize, but the miR399-mediated post-transcriptional pathway was different from Arabidopsis. Abiotic stress-related miRNAs engaged in interactions of different signaling and/or metabolic pathways. Auxin-related miRNAs (zma-miR393, zma-miR160a/b/c, zma-miR160d/e/g, zma-miR167a/b/c/d and zma-miR164a/b/c/d/g) and their targets play important roles in promoting primary root growth, inhibiting lateral root development and retarding upland growth of maize when subjected to low Pi. The changes in expression of miRNAs and their target genes suggest that the miRNA regulation/alterations compose an important mechanism in the adaptation of maize to a low-Pi environment; certain miRNAs participate in root architecture modification via the regulation of auxin signaling. A complex regulatory mechanism of miRNAs in response to a low-Pi environment exists in maize, revealing obvious differences from that in Arabidopsis. Overall design: Maize (Zea mays L.) inbred line Q319 was used in this study. Seeds of the maize inbred line Q319 were surface sterilized and held at 28Ã‚Â°C in darkness.

After 2-3 days of re-culturing in SP nutrient solutions, half of the seedlings were transplanted into a low phosphate (LP, same composition as the SP solution, except that 5 Ã‚ÂµM KH2PO4 and 1 mM KH2PO4 were replaced with 1 mM KCl) nutrient solution. The plants were grown under a 32Ã‚Â°C/25Ã‚Â°C (day/night) temperature regime at a photon flux density (PFD) of 700 Ã‚Âµmol m-2 s-1 with a 14 h/10 h light/dark cycle in a greenhouse with approximately 65% relative humidity. The roots and leaves were then harvested at 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 days and 8 days and cultured in SP solution (as a normal growth control) for small RNA analysis. The samples were frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately and stored at -80? for further analysis. Each biological repeat contains segments from 15~20 plants.

However, the evolutionary path from a neocentromere to a mature centromere has been elusive. Here we analyzed the centromeres of six chromosomes that were transferred from maize into oat as the result of an inter-species cross. Centromere size and location were assayed by chromatin immunoprecipitation for the histone variant CENH3, which is a defining feature of functional centromeres. Maize and oat are highly divergent and differ in genome size by four fold. Two isolates of maize chromosome proved to contain neocentromeres in the sense that they had moved from the original site, whereas the remaining seven centromeres (1, 2, 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10) were retained in the same area in both species. In all cases the CENH3-binding domains were dramatically expanded to encompass a larger area in the oat background (~4 Mb) than the average centromere size in maize (~2 Mb). The expansion of maize centromeres appeared to be restricted by the transcription of genes located in regions flanking the original centromeres. The results from the current study provide evidence that (1) centromere size is regulated; (2) centromere sizes tend to be uniform within a species regardless of chromosome size or origin of the centromere; and (3) neocentromeres emerge and expand preferentially in gene poor regions.

Many HD-Zip genes are characterized in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), and members of the family are being investigated for abiotic stress responses in rice (Oryza sativa), maize (Zea mays), poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and cucumber (Cucmis sativus). Findings in these species suggest HD-Zip genes as high priority candidates for crop improvement. Results In this study we have identified members of the HD-Zip gene family in soybean cv. 'Williams 82', and characterized their expression under dehydration and salt stress. Homology searches with BLASTP and Hidden Markov Model guided sequence alignments identified 101 HD-Zip genes in the soybean genome. Phylogeny reconstruction coupled with domain and gene structure analyses using soybean, Arabidopsis, rice, grape (Vitis vinifera), and Medicago truncatula homologues enabled placement of these sequences into four previously described subfamilies. Of the 101 HD-Zip genes identified in soybean, 88 exist as whole-genome duplication-derived gene pairs, indicating high retention of these genes following polyploidy in Glycine ~10 Mya. The HD-Zip genes exhibit ubiquitous expression patterns across 24 conditions that include 17 tissues of soybean. An RNA-Seq experiment performed to study differential gene expression at 0, 1, 6 and 12 hr soybean roots under dehydration and salt stress identified 20 differentially expressed (DE) genes. Several of these DE genes are orthologs of genes previously reported to play a role under abiotic stress, implying conservation of HD-Zip gene functions across species. Screening of HD-Zip promoters identified transcription factor binding sites that are overrepresented in the DE genes under both dehydration and salt stress, providing further support for the role of HD-Zip genes in abiotic stress responses. Conclusions We provide a thorough description of soybean HD-Zip genes, and identify potential candidates with probable roles in dehydration and salt stress. Expression profiles generated for all soybean genes, under dehydration and salt stress, at four time points, will serve as an important resource for the soybean research community, and will aid in understanding plant responses to abiotic stress. Overall design: We sequenced mRNA from soybean cv. Williams 82 root samples that includes three control samples (0 hr), and three biological replicates for each of the three time points 1, 6 and 12 hr under dehydration and salt stress",NA,"2015"

This small chromosome does not contain any detectable CentC and CRM sequences, but when molecular features of functional centromeres such as CENH3 and CENP-C were examined, they were present. Immunolocalization analysis of phosphorylation of Ser-10 of histone H3 levels on Dp3a shows a pattern typical of a functional centromere. Meiotic analysis revealed that sister chromatids divided equationally at meiosis I as do all small chromosomes examined to date in maize. To examine the sequences associated with CENH3, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out with anti-CENH3 antibodies using material from young seedlings with and without Dp3 chromosome as the tissue source. The ChIPed DNA sample was then labeled for FISH detection and prepared for Illumina sequencing.The ChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the B73 reference genome and a significant peak was detected in the Dp3a sample that span 350 kb of the long arm of chromosome 3, which is the candidate region for association with CENH3. ChIP-bisulfite-seq results indicated that there is a slightly increased DNA methylation level after the centromere formation, approaching the level similar to normal centromere regions. Collectively, the results suggest the formation of a de novo centromere on this fragment that initially must have started at the time of X-irradiation release from the progenitor chromosome. These observations add further evidence for the epigenetic nature of centromere function in maize. Overall design: ChIP-seq was carried out with anti-CENH3 antibodies using material from young seedlings with and without Dp3a chromosome.  For Dp3a, some ChIPed DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and prepared for Illumina sequencing to test its methylation level.",NA,"2013"

Here, we report a procedure for constructing GBS libraries based on reducing genome complexity with restriction enzymes (REs).   This approach is simple, quick, extremely specific, highly reproducible, and may reach important regions of the genome that are inaccessible to sequence capture approaches.  By using methylation-sensitive REs, repetitive regions of genomes can be avoided and lower copy regions targeted with 2-3 fold higher efficiency.  This tremendously simplifies computationally challenging alignment problems in species with high levels of genetic diversity.  The GBS procedure is demonstrated with maize (IBM) and barley (Oregon Wolf Barley) recombinant inbred populations where roughly 200,000 and 25,000 sequence tags were mapped, respectively.  An advantage in species like barley that lack a complete genome sequence is that a reference map need only be developed around the restriction sites, and this can be done in the process of sample genotyping.  In such cases, the consensus of the read clusters across the sequence tags becomes the reference.  Alternatively, for phylogenetic analyses in the absence of a reference genome, the reads can simply be treated as dominant markers.  Future application of GBS to breeding, conservation, and global species and population surveys may allow plant breeders to conduct genomic selection on a novel germplasm or species without first having to develop any prior molecular tools, or conservation biologists to determine population structure without prior knowledge of the genome or diversity in the species.",NA,"2014"

This variation extends to other species in the genus Zea: although maize and Zea luxurians diverged only ~140,000 years ago, their genomes differ in size by ~50%. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing to evaluate the potential contribution of TEs to the genome size difference between these two species.  We aligned the reads both to a filtered gene set and to an exemplar database of unique repeats representing 1514 TE families; ~85% of reads mapped against TE repeats in both species. The relative contribution of TE families to the B73 genome was highly correlated with previous estimates, suggesting that reliable estimates of TE content can be obtained from short high-throughput sequencing reads, even at low coverage. Because we used paired-end reads, we could assess whether a TE was near a gene by determining if one paired read mapped to a TE and the second read mapped to a gene. By this method, Class 2 DNA elements were found significantly more often in genic regions than Class 1 RNA elements, but Class 1 elements were found more often near other TEs. Overall, we found that both Class1 and 2 TE families account for 70% of the genome size difference between B73 and luxurians.

DNA methylation can impact the transposable element (TE) silencing, gene imprinting and regulate gene expression.Through a genome-wide analysis, DNA methylation peaks were respectively characterized and mapped in maize embryo and endosperm genome. Distinct methylation level across maize embryo and endosperm was observed. The maize embryo genome contained more DNA methylation peaks than endosperm. However, the endosperm chloroplast genome contained more DNA methylation peaks to compare with the embryo chloroplast genome. DNA methylation regions were characterized and mapped in genome. More CG island (CGI) shore are methylated than CGI in maize suggested that DNA methylation level is not positively correlated with CpG density. The DNA methylation occurred more frequently in the promoter sequence and transcriptional termination region (TTR) than other regions of the genes. The result showed that 99% TEs we characterized are methylated in maize embryo, but some (34.8%) of them are not methylated in endosperm. Maize embryo and endosperm exhibit distinct pattern/level of methylation. The most differentially methylated two regions between embryo and endosperm are High CpG content promoters (HCPs) and high CpG content TTRs (HCTTRs). DNA methylation peaks distinction of mitochondria and chloroplast DNA were less than the nucleus DNA. Our results indicated that DNA methylation is associated with the gene silencing or gene activation in maize endosperm and embryo. Many genes involved in embryogenesis and seed development were found differentially methylated in embryo and endosperm.

Here we explore limitations to PHB accumulation in sugarcane chloroplasts using a Systems Biology approach, coupled with a metabolic model of C4 photosynthesis. Decreased assimilation was evident in high PHB-producing sugarcane plants, which also showed a dramatic decrease in sucrose and starch content of leaves. A subtle decrease in the C/N ratio was found which was not associated with a decrease in total protein content. An increase in amino acids used for nitrogen recapture was also observed. Based on the accumulation of substrates of ATP-dependent reactions we hypothesised ATP starvation in bundle sheath chloroplasts. This was supported by mRNA differential expression patterns.

We used Illumina sequencing to assess how sRNA populations vary between two maize inbred lines (B73, Mo17) and their hybrid. We sampled sRNAs from the seedling shoot apex and the developing ear, two rapidly growing tissues that program the greater growth of maize hybrids. We found that parental differences in siRNAs primarily originate from repeat regions. Although the maize genome contains greater number and complexity of repeats compared to Arabidopsis or rice, we confirmed that like these simpler plant genomes, 24-nt siRNAs whose abundance differs between maize parents also show a trend of downregulation following hybridization. Surprisingly, hybrid vigor is fully maintained when 24-nt siRNAs are globally reduced by mutation of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase2 (RDR2) encoded by modifier of paramutation1 (mop1). We also discovered that 21-22nt siRNAs derived from a number of distinct retrotransposon families differentially accumulate between B73 and Mo17 as well as their hybrid. Thus, maize possesses a novel source of genetic variation for regulating both transposons and genes at a genomic scale, which may contribute to its high degree of observed heterosis. Overall design: sRNA libraries were derived from RNA isolated from the seedling shoot apex and developing ear tissues from B73, Mo17, B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73. The shoot apex was chosen because it is enriched for meristematic tissue where cell proliferation occurs, rates of organ initiation are determined, and organ size is specified. The developing ear was examined because it is enriched in meristematic tissue and is undergoing rapid growth, and also because the mature ear shows the highest degree of heterosis. Total RNA was isolated and separated on a 15% TBE-Urea polyacrylamide gel. Using a 10-bp ladder, the sRNA fraction representing 10-40-bp was excised. sRNA libraries were prepared according to Lu et al. (2007) or manufacturer's instructitions (Illumina). A combination of Perl scripts and FASTX toolkit scripts were used to remove adapters, collapse identical sequences and count reads per sequence. Supplementary processed data text files contain the distinct sRNA sequences for all of the genotypes analyzed in that experiment. Abundance (reads per million) was calculated for each distinct sequence by dividing the number of reads of distinct sRNA in a library by the total number of sRNA reads for that library and multiplying this by 1 million.

The methyltransferase HEN1 stabilizes plant miRNAs, animal piRNAs, and siRNAs in both kingdoms via 3' terminal methylation. Loss of HEN1 in plants results in non-templated oligo-uridylation and accelerated degradation of miRNAs. In hen1 mutants from Arabidopsis and rice, we found that the patterns of miRNA truncation and uridylation differ substantially among miRNA families, but such patterns for the same miRNA are conserved between species. miR166 and miR163 are truncated predominantly to ~17 and ~16 nt, and subsequently recover via uridylation to approximately their original sizes, 21 and 24 nt, suggesting that in these cases miRNA truncation triggers uridylation. miR171 is untruncated but uridylated to 22 nt in hen1 mutants, gaining the ability to trigger production of phased, secondary siRNAs. Truncated and tailed variants were bound by ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) in hen1, implying that these events occur while miRNAs are still bound by AGO1. Unexpectedly, a portion of miR158 in wildtype remains unmethylated and thus subject to uridylation and destabilization, suggesting that plants naturally utilize miRNA methylation to modulate miRNA accumulation. Our results suggest that the AGO1-containing RISC complex may undergo programming to reflect each bound miRNA, determining a defined, distinct decay destiny. Overall design: In this analysis, we sequenced sRNAs from two hen1 mutant alleles in Arabidopsis and three hen1 alleles in rice. In Arabidopsis, the strong hen1-1 allele in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype is the first hen1 mutant and emerged from an enhancer screen in the hua1-1/hua2-1 background, and hen1-8 in the Columbia (Col) background is a weak allele. In rice, WAVY LEAF1 (WAF1) is the ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, and two mutant alleles waf1-1 and waf1-2 each bear a single-base substitution leading to a premature stop codon in the second exon and a non-functional splicing site of the fourth intron, respectively.

We compared transcriptional profiles of the cob and peripheral florets of a maize hybrid at the silking stage at two N levels in the field and found 1,864 differentially expressed genes between the cob and florets, with 1314 genes up-regulated in the cob and 550 genes up-regulated in florets. The cob was featured by preferential expression of 161 genes, with striking enrichment of genes that are involved in transport facilitation and energy metabolism, consistent with the physiological role of the cob in C/N storage and transfer during ear development. The florets were characteristic of preferential expression of 108 genes, with enrichment of genes that are involved in the cellular process and lipid biosynthetic process. LN caused differential expression of 588 genes in the cob and only 195 genes in florets, indicating that the cob dominated the response of the ear to LN at the transcriptional level. Differentially expressed genes under LN were involved in C/N metabolism, transcriptional regulation, development, cell rescue and defense, and signal transduction in the cob and/or florets. The expression level of 106 genes was regulated by LN in both tissues, suggesting a common regulatory network in these two functionally distinct tissues under LN.

We conducted a genome-wide survey of maize miRNA genes, characterizing their structure, expression, and evolution. Computational approaches based on homology and secondary structure modeling identified 150 high-confidence genes within 26 miRNA families. For 25 families, expression was verified by deep-sequencing of small RNA libraries that were prepared from an assortment of maize tissues. PCR-RACE amplification of 68 miRNA transcript precursors, representing 18 families conserved across several plant species, showed that splice variation and the use of alternative transcriptional start and stop sites is common within this class of genes. Comparison of sequence variation data from diverse maize inbred lines versus teosinte accessions suggest that the mature miRNAs are under strong purifying selection while the flanking sequences evolve equivalently to other genes. Since maize is derived from an ancient tetraploid, the effect of whole-genome duplication on miRNA evolution was examined. We found that, like protein-coding genes, duplicated miRNA genes underwent extensive gene-loss, with ~35% of duplicate homeologous miRNA genes retained. This number is higher than that observed with protein-coding genes. A search for putative miRNA targets indicated a bias towards genes in regulatory and metabolic pathways. As maize is one of the principal models for plant growth and development, this study will serve as a foundation for future research into the functional roles of miRNA genes.

We applied sequencing approaches to quantify RNA expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification distributions genome-wide in maize (Zea mays), focusing on centromeres and pericentromeres. Aside from the presence of the Histone H3 variant common to all centromeres, Centromeric Histone H3 (CENH3), we found no RNA expression or chromatin modifications that clearly differentiate centromeres from the immediate flanking regions. In general, both RNA expression and chromatin modification frequencies were a function of distance from the centromere, either peaking or dipping toward arms, with the vertices within the centromere. These results do not lend themselves well to models suggesting that specialized heterochromatic regions are required to enable centromere function. Our data suggest that visible pericentromeric heterochromatin in maize and many other species reflects the sharp transition between CENH3 chromatin and H3 chromatin and gradual distance-correlated changes similar to the frequency of recombination in flanking regions.","In this study, we compared siRNA abundance across centromere/pericentromere regions of maize chromosomes by Illumina sequencing a library of small RNAs (selecting for species with 5' and 3' ends already compatible for ligation, i.e., 5' monophosphates and 3' hydroxyls). We also compared DNA methylation across centromere/pericentromere regions of maize chromosomes by bisulfite sequencing of DNA fragments generated by micrococcal nuclease.

This procedure, however, requires access to quantitative genetic markers that are polymorphic in the mapping population. We have developed a modification of BSA (BSR-Seq) that makes use of RNA-Seq reads to efficiently map genes even in populations for which no polymorphic markers have been previously identified. Because of the digital nature of next-generation sequencing (NGS) data, it is possible to conduct de novo SNP discovery and quantitatively genotype BSA samples using the same RNA-Seq data. In addition, analysis of the RNA-Seq data provides information on the effects of the mutant on global patterns of gene expression at no extra cost.  In combination these results greatly simplify gene cloning experiments.      To demonstrate the utility of this strategy BSR-Seq was used to clone the glossy3 (gl3) gene of maize. Mutants of the glossy loci exhibit altered accumulation of epicuticular waxes on juvenile leaves.  We previously generated a large collection of glossy mutants using the Mu transposon system.  By subjected a reference allele to BSR-Seq, we were able to map the gl3 locus to a ~2.3Mb interval that is consistent with the results of prior mapping experiments. The single gene located in the 2.3Mb mapping interval that contained a Mu insertion and whose expression was down-regulated in the mutant pool was subsequently demonstrated to be the gl3 gene via the analysis of multiple independently Mu transposon induced mutant alleles.

It progresses through three recognizable phases of pathogenic development *in planta*: melanized appressoria that form on the host surface prior to penetration; biotrophy, characterized by colonization of living host cells; and necrotrophy, characterized by host cell death and symptom development. An improved filtering algorithm and a Mixed Effects Generalized Linear Model (GLM) were developed and applied to an existing Illumina transcriptome dataset, substantially increasing the statistical power of the analysis of *C. graminicola* gene expression during infection and colonization. Additionally, the *in planta* transcriptome of the wild-type was compared with that of a mutant strain impaired in the establishment of biotrophy, allowing detailed dissection of events occurring specifically during penetration, and during early versus late biotrophy. Results indicated that there is a continuum of activities that occur during colonization of maize by *C. graminicola*, and that boundaries drawn between the three recognizable phases are artificial. More than 2000 fungal genes were differentially transcribed in waves during appressorial maturation, penetration, and colonization. Secreted proteins and membrane receptors were over-represented among the differentially expressed genes, suggesting that the fungus engages in an intimate and dynamic conversation with the host, beginning prior to penetration. This communication process is likely to involve reception of plant signals that trigger subsequent developmental progress in the fungus, as well as the production of signals that induce responses in the host. Later phases of biotrophy were more similar to necrotrophy, with increased production of secreted proteases, inducers of plant cell death, hydrolases, and membrane bound transporters for the uptake and egress of potential toxins, signals, and nutrients. The differentially expressed genes could be used as landmarks to more accurately identify developmental progress in compatible versus incompatible interactions involving genetic variants of both host and pathogen.

Assuming that soil properties are the major drivers of soil bacterial diversity and structure, within the same soil type, can the plant cover cause significant shifts on soil bacterial community composition? To address this question we used 16S rRNA pyrosequencing to detect differences in diversity, composition and/or relative abundance of bacterial taxa from an area covered by pristine forest and eight years old grassland surrounded by this forest. After removing the natural forest, the soil bacterial community did not suffer a great differentiation. Sixty nine percent of the operational taxonomic unities (OTUs) were shared between environments. Overall, forest samples and grassland samples presented the same diversity and the clustering analysis did not show the occurrence of very distinctive bacterial communities between environments. However, we detected eleven OTUs in statistically significantly higher abundance in the forest samples but in lower abundance in the grassland samples and twelve OTUs in statistically significantly higher abundance in the grassland samples but in lower abundance in the forest samples. Those results illustrate that as long as the soil chemical and physical conditions do not suffer great alterations, the recent history of land use buffers the shifts of soil bacterial community.",NA,"2015"

In order to investigate disease-resistance mechanisms at this early seedling stage, digital gene expression (DGE) analysis, which applies a dual-enzyme approach (DpnII and NlaIII), was used to identify the transcriptional changes in roots of Huangzao4 (susceptible) and Mo17 (resistant) after inoculation with teliospores of S. reilianum. Before and after inoculation, pathogenesis-related genes were differentially regulated and enzymes involved in controlling reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels showed different activity between Huangzao4 and Mo17, which can potentially lead to changes in the growth of S. reilianum and ROS production in maize. Moreover, lignin depositions of roots were also changed differentially during root colonization of hyphae between Huangzao4 and Mo17. These results suggest that the interplays between S. reilianum and maize during the early infection stage involve many interesting transcriptional and physiological changes, which offer several novel insights for understanding the mechanisms of resistance to the fungal infection.

Although widely exploited in agriculture, the mechanisms responsible for heterosis are not well understood.  As a monoecious organism, a given maize plant can be used as both male and female parents of crosses.  Regardless of the cross direction, the maize inbred lines B73 and Mo17 produce hybrids that substantially out-perform their parents.  These reciprocal hybrids differ phenotypically from each other despite having identical nuclear genomes.  Consistent with these phenotypic observations, 30-50% of genes were differentially expressed between these reciprocal hybrids.  An eQTL experiment conducted to better understand the regulation of gene expression in inbred and hybrid lines detected ~4,000 eQTL associations.  The majority of these eQTL act in trans to regulate expression of genes on other chromosomes.  Surprisingly, many of the trans-eQTL, when heterozygous, differentially regulated transcript accumulation in a manner consistent with gene expression in the hybrid being regulated exclusively by the paternally transmitted allele.  The design of the eQTL experiment controlled for cytoplasmic and maternal effects, suggesting that widespread paternal genomic imprinting contributes to the regulation of gene expression in maize hybrids. Keywords: eQTL, parent-of-origin Overall design: GPL4521 - SAM1.2 (Reciprocal Hybrid Comparison): Six replications of B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73 were grown in growth chambers to tightly control environmental variation.  Seeds from each genotype were taken from a single source (ear) for all six replications.  Within each replication, genotypes were randomly assigned growth locations.  Six healthy seedlings for each genotype and replication were harvested at two weeks of age.  For each replication, B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73 were hybridized to the SAM1.2 microarray (GPL4521) using a randomized, alternate dye assignment. GPL3333 - SAM1.1 and GPL3538 - SAM3.0 (eQTL Experiment): Four biological replications of the RIL, B73xRIL, and Mo17xRIL cross-types were planted in growth chambers using seed from a single source for each genotype.   Each RIL and its crosses onto B73 and Mo17 were planted using a split-plot design with RIL group (RIL and its cross onto B73 and Mo17) as the whole-plot treatment factor and cross-type (RIL, B73xRIL, and Mo17xRIL) as the split-plot treatment factor.  The whole-plot portion of the experiment was designed as a randomized complete block design with four replications carried out on four separate occasions in the same environment.  For the split-plot portion of the design, twelve seedlings of each RIL and its crosses were randomized within two adjacent flats in a growth chamber (six healthy seedlings per genotype were randomly chosen and pooled at harvest).  For each replication, RIL, B73xRIL, and Mo17xRIL cross-types were hybridized to custom cDNA microarrays using a loop design such that each loop included all pairwise comparisons between the RIL and its crosses with B73 and Mo17.  Four biological replications were hybridized to the SAM1.1 (GPL3333) array and two of the four biological replications were hybridized to SAM3.0 (GPL3538).  RNA samples were alternately labeled to provide dye balance within each loop and replication.

The reciprocal B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73 hybrids are both highly heterotic, but despite having identical nuclear genomes exhibit statistically significant differences in multiple traits. RNA-seq experiment was conducted to compare the gene expression globally between the two reciprocal hybrids. 1 samples from B73XMo17 and Mo17XB73 RNAs were extracted from a single replication of 14-day-old B73xMo17 and Mo17xB73 seedlings.

RNAÃ¢â‚¬â€œdependent RNA polymerase 2 (RDR2) is a component of the RNAÃ¢â‚¬â€œdirected DNA methylation (RdDM) silencing pathway. In maize, loss of mediator of paramutation1 (mop1) encoded RDR2 function results in reactivation of transcriptionally silenced Mu transposons and a substantial reduction in the accumulation of 24 nt short-interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that recruit RNA silencing components. An RNAÃ¢â‚¬â€œseq experiment conducted on shoot apical meristems (SAMs) revealed that, as expected based on a model in which RDR2 generates 24 nt siRNAs that suppress expression, most differentially expressed DNA TEs (78%) were up-regulated in the mop1 mutant. In contrast, most differentially expressed retrotransposons (68%) were down-regulated. This striking difference suggests that distinct silencing mechanisms are applied to different silencing templates. In addition, 6,000 genes (24% of analyzed genes), including nearly 80% (286/361) of genes in chromatin modification pathways, were differentially expressed. Overall, two-thirds of differentially regulated genes were down-regulated in the mop1 mutant. This finding suggests that RDR2 plays a significant role in regulating the expression of not only transposons, but also of genes. A re-analysis of existing small RNA data identified both RDR2Ã¢â‚¬â€œsensitive and RDR2Ã¢â‚¬â€œresistant species of 24 nt siRNAs that we hypothesize may at least partially explain the complex changes in the expression of genes and transposons observed in the mop1 mutant.

Further, computational approaches were used to predict the stress-related cis-regulatory elements on the promoters of these miRNAs using the B73 reference and a miRNA-mediated gene regulatory network was constructed. The differential expression patterns of miRNAs and their targets in these three inbred lines suggest that the miRNAs are active participants in the signal transduction at the early stage of hypoxia conditions via a complex network and biochemical pathways. Our study also suggests that there might be a miRNA-mediated energy-saving strategy in surviving from waterlogging.

Despite their importance for plant development, the genomic network targeted by KNOX proteins is poorly understood. Using ChIP-seq, we defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci. To understand how these binding occupancies correlate with changes in transcriptional regulation, we performed RNA-seq on immature ears and tassels, and compared expression profiles between normal and loss-of-function kn1 plants, in addition to immature leaves from normal and gain-of-function Kn1 plants. We found that 643 of the KN1 targets were modulated in one or multiple tissues, with a strong enrichment for transcription factors (including other homeobox genes) and genes participating in several hormonal pathways, most significantly auxin, implicating KN1 at the crossroads of plant hormone signaling. The loss-of-function kn1 phenotype is reminiscent of auxin mutants and kn1 mis-expression in leaves correlates with increased auxin signaling. Our results demonstrate that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant meristem identity and function.

Methodology/Principal findings:                 Forty male pigs (~40 days old) were blocked by weight and litter ancestry and                 assigned to one of four treatments; 1) Isogenic maize-based diet for 110 days                 (Isogenic); 2) Bt maize-based diet (MON810) for 110 days (Bt); 3) Isogenic                 maize-based diet for 30 days followed by a Bt maize-based diet for 80 days                 (Isogenic/Bt); 4) Bt maize-based diet for 30 days followed by an isogenic                 maize-based diet for 80 days (Bt/Isogenic). Using culture-based methods,                 Enterobacteriaceae, Lactobacillus and total anaerobes were enumerated in the feces                 on days 0, 30, 60 and 100 of the study and in ileal and cecal digesta on day 110. No                 differences were found between treatments for any of these counts at any time point.                 The relative abundance of cecal bacteria was also determined using high-throughput                 16S rRNA gene sequencing. No differences were observed in any bacterial taxa between                 treatments, with the exception of the genus Holdemania which was more abundant in                 the cecum of pigs fed the isogenic/Bt treatment compared to pigs fed the Bt                 treatment (0.012 vs 0.003%; P = 0.05). Conclusions/Significance: Feeding pigs a Bt                 maize-based diet for 110 days did not affect counts of any of the culturable                 bacteria enumerated in the feces, ileum or cecum. Neither did it influence the                 composition of the cecal microbiota with the exception of a minor increase in the                 genus Holdemania. As the role of Holdemania in the intestine is still under                 investigation and no health abnormalities were observed, this change is not likely                 to be of clinical significance.

Abstract: The                 objective of this study was to investigate if feeding genetically modified (GM) Bt                 maize had any effects on the porcine intestinal microbiota. Eighteen pigs were                 weaned at ~28 days, and following a 6 day acclimatization period, were assigned to                 diets containing either GM (Bt MON810) or non-GM isogenic parent line maize for 31                 days. Effects on the porcine intestinal microbiota were assessed through                 culture-dependent and -independent approaches. Fecal, cecal and ileal counts of                 total anaerobes, Enterobacteriaceae and Lactobacillus were not significantly                 different between pigs fed the isogenic or Bt maize-based diets. Furthermore,                 high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing revealed few differences in the composition                 of the cecal microbiota. The only differences that were observed were that pigs fed                 the Bt maize-based diet had higher abundance of cecal Enterobacteriaceae (0.007 vs                 0.001; P <0.05), Helicobacteraceae (0.002 vs 0.0004; P gt;0.05), Helicobacter                 (0.002 vs 0.0004; P <0.05) and Bacteroides (0.001 vs 0.0005; P <0.05) compared                 to pigs fed the isogenic maize-based diet. Bt maize-fed pigs also had lower                 abundance of fibre-fermenting bacteria (Prevotella, Ruminococcus, Eubacterium,                 Faecalibacterium, Fibrobacter, Clostridium, Bacteroides and Butyrivibrio) when these                 were analyzed as a group (0.13 vs 0.22; P <0.05). A lower concentration of enzyme                 resistant starch in the Bt maize may account for some of the differences in                 taxonomic distribution observed within the cecal microbiota. Overall, these results                 indicate that Bt maize is well tolerated at the level of the porcine intestinal                 microbiota and provide additional data for safety assessment of Bt maize.                 680.",NA,"2016"

We screened the microbial diversity across a land use transect via high throughput sequencing of partial 16S rRNA gene amplicons. Land use had a major effect on soil properties and microbial community structures. Total organic carbon (TOC) and pH were major diversity drivers for Bacteria, while pH was important for Archaea. We identified the potential contribution of soil amendments to the indigenous microbial communities, and also gained insights about potential roles of taxa in the organic carbon turnover. Verrucomicrobia, coincided with the higher values of the recalcitrant organic carbon while Actinobacteria and Acidobacteria correlated with the more labile organic carbon.

In this study, two small RNA libraries were sequenced, and a total of 11,973,711 and 14,326,010 raw sequences were generated from growing leaves of drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive maize seedlings, respectively. Further analysis identified 192 mature miRNAs, which include 124 known maize (zma) miRNAs and 68 potential novel miRNA candidates. Additionally, 167 target genes (259 transcripts) of known and novel miRNAs were predicted to be differentially expressed between two maize inbred lines. Of these, three novel miRNAs were up-regulated and two were down-regulated under drought stress. The expression of these five miRNAs and nine target genes was confirmed using quantitative reverse transcription PCR. The expression of three of the miRNAs and their putative target genes exhibited an inverse correlation, and expression analysis suggested that all five may play important roles in maize leaves. Finally, GO annotations of the target genes indicated a potential role in photosynthesis, may therefore contribute to the drought stress response. This study describes the identification and characterization of novel miRNAs that are the differentially expressed in drought-tolerant and drought-sensitive inbred maize lines.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are the two major types, both of which have a demonstrated and important role in plant development, stress responses and pathogen resistance. In this work, we used a deep sequencing approach (Sequencing-By-Synthesis, or SBS) to develop sequence resources of small RNAs from different maize tissues (including leaves, ears and tassels) collected from wild-type plants of the B73 variety. The high depth of the resulting datasets enabled us to examine in detail critical small RNA features as size distribution, tissue-specific regulation and sequence conservation between different organs in this species. We also developed database resources and a dedicated website (http://smallrna.udel.edu/) with computational tools for allowing other users to identify new miRNAs or siRNAs involved in specific regulatory pathways, verify the degree of conservation of these sequences in other plant species and map small RNAs on genes or larger regions of the maize genome under study. Overall design: Small RNA libraries were derived from leaves, ears and tassels of maize variety B73 (wild-type). Plants were grown in a flood irrigated plot at the University of Arizona (Tucson, AZ, USA) in 2007 and organs were pooled from several plants for each library. Young leaves were collected from 6-weeks-old seedlings. Post-meiotic immature ears were harvested from 10- and 11-week old plants while pre-meiotic tassels were collected from 8-week old plants. Total RNA was isolated using the Plant RNA Purification Reagent (Invitrogen) and submitted to Illumina (Hayward, CA, http://www.illumina.com) for small RNA library construction using approaches described in (Lu et al., 2007) with minor modifications. The small RNA libraries were sequenced with the Sequencing-By-Synthesis (SBS) technology by Illumina. PERL scripts were designed to remove the adapter sequences and determine the abundance of each distinct small RNA.

Here we explore the impact of four bioenergy feedstock crops (maize, switchgrass, Miscanthus X giganteus, and mixed tallgrass prairie) on nitrogen cycling microorganisms in the soil. By analyzing key functional genes (nifH, bacterial amoA, archaeal amoA and nosZ) and 16S rRNA genes, we monitored changes in the quantity (real-time PCR) and diversity (barcoded pyrosequencing) of diazotrophic bacteria, ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) and archaea (AOA), denitrifying bacteria and the overall bacterial/archaeal community over two years after crop establishment. Over time, the quantities of these N-cycling genes were relatively stable in all the crops, except maize (the only fertilized crop), in which the population size of AOB doubled in less than 3 months, and denitrifier abundance increased in comparison to the other crops in the second season. Deep sequencing revealed high diversity of nifH, archaeal amoA, bacterial amoA, nosZ and 16S rRNA genes, with 10899, 3187, 3945, 11242 and 19824 unique nucleotide sequences observed, respectively. Rarefaction analysis revealed the diversity of archaeal amoA in maize significantly decreased in the second year. Among the observed bacterial genera, covering nine phyla, 31.8% were significantly changed in at least one crop. Unifrac PCoA  analysis showed that the N-transforming microbial community structures in the soil under these crops changed following different trajectories. Thus far, our two year study has shown that specific N-transforming microbial communities develop in the soil in response to planting different bioenergy crops, and each functional group responded in a different way. Our results also suggest that application of fertilizer increases the abundance of AOB and denitrifiers, reduces the diversity of AOA, and significant changes in the structure of these N-transforming populations.",NA,"2014"

Most capture protocols require blocking DNA, the production of which in large quantities can prove challenging. A blocker-free, two-stage capture protocol was developed using NimbleGen arrays. The first capture depletes the library of repetitive sequences, while the second enriches for target loci. This strategy was used to resequence non-repetitive portions of an approximately 2.2 Mb chromosomal interval and a set of 43 genes dispersed in the 2.3 Gb maize genome. This approach achieved approximately 1800-3000-fold enrichment and 80-98% coverage of targeted bases. More than 2500 SNPs were identified in target genes. Low rates of false-positive SNP predictions were obtained, even in the presence of captured paralogous sequences. Importantly, it was possible to recover novel sequences from non-reference alleles. The ability to design novel repeat-subtraction and target capture arrays makes this technology accessible in any species.",NA,"2013"

The approximately one dozen distinct Mu transposons contain highly similar ~215 bp Terminal Inverted Repeats (TIRs) and generate 9-bp Target Site Duplications (TSDs) upon insertion. Using a novel chromosome walking strategy that uses these conserved TIRs as primer binding sites, Mu insertion sites were amplified from Mu stocks and sequenced via the 454 FLX platform.","DLA, a genome walking method, was adapted for sequencing Mu flanking sequences using the 454 FLX platform.  Mu flanking sequences from different Mu lines were amplified by a genome walking method, DLA (Liu et al., Genetics, Submitted) and pooled for the 454 pyrosequencing. The primers used to construct the DNA library are composite primers. DNA barcodes (6 bp) were inserted between the 454 primer A and the Mu-specific primer to allow different input samples that were pooled in the same 454 run to be distinguished after sequencing. The resulting library amplified with Primer 1 and Primer 2 was subjected to 454 sequencing using 454 primer A. Totally, Gl2 and Mu2 samples were subjected to sequencing. Each experiences two technical replication. Each replication was run in the half plate.","2013"
