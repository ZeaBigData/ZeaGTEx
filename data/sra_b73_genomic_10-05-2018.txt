This variation extends to other species in the genus Zea: although maize and Zea luxurians diverged only ~140,000 years ago, their genomes differ in size by ~50%. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing to evaluate the potential contribution of TEs to the genome size difference between these two species.  We aligned the reads both to a filtered gene set and to an exemplar database of unique repeats representing 1514 TE families; ~85% of reads mapped against TE repeats in both species. The relative contribution of TE families to the B73 genome was highly correlated with previous estimates, suggesting that reliable estimates of TE content can be obtained from short high-throughput sequencing reads, even at low coverage. Because we used paired-end reads, we could assess whether a TE was near a gene by determining if one paired read mapped to a TE and the second read mapped to a gene. By this method, Class 2 DNA elements were found significantly more often in genic regions than Class 1 RNA elements, but Class 1 elements were found more often near other TEs. Overall, we found that both Class1 and 2 TE families account for 70% of the genome size difference between B73 and luxurians. Interestingly, the relative abundance of TE families was conserved between species (r=0.99), suggesting genome-wide control of TE content rather than family-specific effects.

This variation extends to other species in the genus Zea: although maize and Zea luxurians diverged only ~140,000 years ago, their genomes differ in size by ~50%. We used paired-end Illumina sequencing to evaluate the potential contribution of TEs to the genome size difference between these two species.  We aligned the reads both to a filtered gene set and to an exemplar database of unique repeats representing 1514 TE families; ~85% of reads mapped against TE repeats in both species. The relative contribution of TE families to the B73 genome was highly correlated with previous estimates, suggesting that reliable estimates of TE content can be obtained from short high-throughput sequencing reads, even at low coverage. Because we used paired-end reads, we could assess whether a TE was near a gene by determining if one paired read mapped to a TE and the second read mapped to a gene. By this method, Class 2 DNA elements were found significantly more often in genic regions than Class 1 RNA elements, but Class 1 elements were found more often near other TEs. Overall, we found that both Class1 and 2 TE families account for 70% of the genome size difference between B73 and luxurians. Interestingly, the relative abundance of TE families was conserved between species (r=0.99), suggesting genome-wide control of TE content rather than family-specific effects.

We applied sequencing approaches to quantify RNA expression, DNA methylation, and histone modification distributions genome-wide in maize (Zea mays), focusing on centromeres and pericentromeres. Aside from the presence of the Histone H3 variant common to all centromeres, Centromeric Histone H3 (CENH3), we found no RNA expression or chromatin modifications that clearly differentiate centromeres from the immediate flanking regions. In general, both RNA expression and chromatin modification frequencies were a function of distance from the centromere, either peaking or dipping toward arms, with the vertices within the centromere. These results do not lend themselves well to models suggesting that specialized heterochromatic regions are required to enable centromere function. Our data suggest that visible pericentromeric heterochromatin in maize and many other species reflects the sharp transition between CENH3 chromatin and H3 chromatin and gradual distance-correlated changes similar to the frequency of recombination in flanking regions.	analysis of centromere and pericentromere epigenetic features	In this study, we compared siRNA abundance across centromere/pericentromere regions of maize chromosomes by Illumina sequencing a library of small RNAs (selecting for species with 5' and 3' ends already compatible for ligation, i.e., 5' monophosphates and 3' hydroxyls). We also compared DNA methylation across centromere/pericentromere regions of maize chromosomes by bisulfite sequencing of DNA fragments generated by micrococcal nuclease. These fragments, mainly corresponding to single nucleosome cores, were enriched for centromeres by chromatin immunoprecipitation with CENH3 antibodies prior to bisulfite treatment and Illumina library preparation.

Despite their importance for plant development, the genomic network targeted by KNOX proteins is poorly understood. Using ChIP-seq, we defined the KN1 cistrome in maize inflorescences and found that KN1 binds to several thousand loci. To understand how these binding occupancies correlate with changes in transcriptional regulation, we performed RNA-seq on immature ears and tassels, and compared expression profiles between normal and loss-of-function kn1 plants, in addition to immature leaves from normal and gain-of-function Kn1 plants. We found that 643 of the KN1 targets were modulated in one or multiple tissues, with a strong enrichment for transcription factors (including other homeobox genes) and genes participating in several hormonal pathways, most significantly auxin, implicating KN1 at the crossroads of plant hormone signaling. The loss-of-function kn1 phenotype is reminiscent of auxin mutants and kn1 mis-expression in leaves correlates with increased auxin signaling. Our results demonstrate that KN1 plays a key role in orchestrating the upper levels of a hierarchical gene regulatory network that impacts plant meristem identity and function.

Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA.

These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.

We have determined the genome-wide cytosine methylation map of two maize inbred lines, B73 and Mo17, at high coverage and at single nucleotide resolution. Transposon methylation is highest in CG (65%) and CHG (50%) contexts (where H = A, C or T), while methylation in CHH (5%) contexts is guided by 24nt small interfering RNA (siRNA), and not by 21-22nt siRNA. We have found that CG (8%) methylation seems to deter insertion of Mutator transposons into exons, while CHH and CHG methylation at splice donor and acceptor sites strongly inhibits RNA splicing. Methylation differences between parents are inherited in recombinant inbred lines, but methylation switches, guided by siRNA, are widespread and persist for up to 8 generations. These differences influence splicing, and recurrent switching suggest that paramutation is much more common than previously supposed, and may contribute to heterosis.  Our results provide a comprehensive high resolution resource for maize genome methylation, as well as a map of recurrent transgenerational epigenetic shifts (paramutation) in the two most commonly used inbred maize lines.

Meiotic analysis revealed that sister chromatids divided equationally at meiosis I as do all small chromosomes examined to date in maize.

The ChIPed DNA sample was then labeled for FISH detection and prepared for Illumina sequencing.The ChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the B73 reference genome and a significant peak was detected in the Dp3a sample that span 350 kb of the long arm of chromosome 3, which is the candidate region for association with CENH3. ChIP-bisulfite-seq results indicated that there is a slightly increased DNA methylation level after the centromere formation, approaching the level similar to normal centromere regions. Collectively, the results suggest the formation of a de novo centromere on this fragment that initially must have started at the time of X-irradiation release from the progenitor chromosome.

This small chromosome does not contain any detectable CentC and CRM sequences, but when molecular features of functional centromeres such as CENH3 and CENP-C were examined, they were present. Immunolocalization analysis of phosphorylation of Ser-10 of histone H3 levels on Dp3a shows a pattern typical of a functional centromere. Meiotic analysis revealed that sister chromatids divided equationally at meiosis I as do all small chromosomes examined to date in maize. To examine the sequences associated with CENH3, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) was carried out with anti-CENH3 antibodies using material from young seedlings with and without Dp3 chromosome as the tissue source. The ChIPed DNA sample was then labeled for FISH detection and prepared for Illumina sequencing.The ChIP-Seq reads were mapped to the B73 reference genome and a significant peak was detected in the Dp3a sample that span 350 kb of the long arm of chromosome 3, which is the candidate region for association with CENH3. ChIP-bisulfite-seq results indicated that there is a slightly increased DNA methylation level after the centromere formation, approaching the level similar to normal centromere regions. Collectively, the results suggest the formation of a de novo centromere on this fragment that initially must have started at the time of X-irradiation release from the progenitor chromosome. These observations add further evidence for the epigenetic nature of centromere function in maize. Overall design: ChIP-seq was carried out with anti-CENH3 antibodies using material from young seedlings with and without Dp3a chromosome.  For Dp3a, some ChIPed DNA was treated with sodium bisulfite and prepared for Illumina sequencing to test its methylation level.

Here, we generated the integrated maps of transcriptomes and epigenomes of shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids, and globally surveyed the epigenetic variations and their relationships with transcriptional divergence between different tissues and different genotypes. We observed that whereas histone modifications vary both between tissues and between genotypes, DNA methylation patterns are more distinguishable between genotypes than between tissues. Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between tissues and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements (TEs), and for different TEs in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species. Together, our results suggest that despite of the variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different tissues of maize hybrids.

Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements (TEs), and for different TEs in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species. Together, our results suggest that despite of the variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different tissues of maize hybrids.

Here, we generated the integrated maps of transcriptomes and epigenomes of shoots and roots of two maize inbred lines and their reciprocal hybrids, and globally surveyed the epigenetic variations and their relationships with transcriptional divergence between different tissues and different genotypes. We observed that whereas histone modifications vary both between tissues and between genotypes, DNA methylation patterns are more distinguishable between genotypes than between tissues. Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between tissues and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements (TEs), and for different TEs in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species. Together, our results suggest that despite of the variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different tissues of maize hybrids.

Histone modifications were associated with transcriptomic divergence between tissues and between hybrids and parents. Further, we show that genes up-regulated in both shoots and roots of hybrids were significantly enriched in the nucleosome assembly pathway. Interestingly, 22- and 24-nt siRNAs were shown to be derived from distinct transposable elements (TEs), and for different TEs in both shoots and roots, the differences in siRNA activity between hybrids and patents were primarily driven by different siRNA species. Together, our results suggest that despite of the variations in specific genes or genomic loci, similar mechanisms may account for the genome-wide epigenetic regulation of gene activity and transposon stability in different tissues of maize hybrids. Overall design: Genome-wide integrated maps of mRNA and small RNA (sRNA) transcriptomes, DNA methylomes and genome-wide distribution of three representative histone modifications (H3K4me3, H3K9ac and H3K36me3) in the shoots and roots of 14 day old seedlings of two maize inbred lines (B73 and Mo17) and their reciprocal hybrids (B73 x Mo17 and Mo17 x B73).

Briefly, 14-day whole-seedling gDNA was isolated from B73 and Mo17 inbred lines planted independently from samples used in meDIP analysis. Samples were fragmented, and TruSeq methylated adapters were ligated to DNA fragments. 500ng of adapter-ligated DNA underwent bisulfite conversion using the MethylCode bisulfite conversion kit (Life technologies) per manufacturers protocol. Converted DNA was split into 4 reactions and amplified using Pfu Turbo Cx DNA Polymerase (Agilent) for four cycles and subsequently pooled. Libraries were sequenced on the HiSeq 2000 (Illumina) for 100 cycles, paired-end.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81N4HABXX_2	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034400	plate_81N4HABXX_2	SRS417506	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE8ABXX_4	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034388	plate_81FE8ABXX_4	SRS417494	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FENABXX_6	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034397	plate_81FENABXX_6	SRS417503	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_D0D7RACXX_2	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina HiSeq 2000	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina HiSeq 2000	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034412	plate_D0D7RACXX_2	SRS417520	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE7ABXX_2	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034379	plate_81FE7ABXX_2	SRS417485	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FENABXX_3	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034394	plate_81FENABXX_3	SRS417500	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE7ABXX_4	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034381	plate_81FE7ABXX_4	SRS417487	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE7ABXX_5	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034382	plate_81FE7ABXX_5	SRS417488	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE8ABXX_5	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034389	plate_81FE8ABXX_5	SRS417495	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE8ABXX_6	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034390	plate_81FE8ABXX_6	SRS417496	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81N4HABXX_3	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034401	plate_81N4HABXX_3	SRS417507	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FENABXX_2	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034393	plate_81FENABXX_2	SRS417499	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FENABXX_1	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034392	plate_81FENABXX_1	SRS417498	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE7ABXX_3	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034380	plate_81FE7ABXX_3	SRS417486	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_8042MABXX_4	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034377	plate_8042MABXX_4	SRS417483	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE8ABXX_1	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034385	plate_81FE8ABXX_1	SRS417491	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE8ABXX_7	OTHER	GENOMIC	other	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034391	plate_81FE8ABXX_7	SRS417497	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_D0D0BACXX_1	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina HiSeq 2000	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina HiSeq 2000	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034408	plate_D0D0BACXX_1	SRS417516	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81N4HABXX_4	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034402	plate_81N4HABXX_4	SRS417508	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE7ABXX_6	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034383	plate_81FE7ABXX_6	SRS417489	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81N4HABXX_6	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034404	plate_81N4HABXX_6	SRS417510	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81N4HABXX_7	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034405	plate_81N4HABXX_7	SRS417511	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FENABXX_5	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034396	plate_81FENABXX_5	SRS417502	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FE7ABXX_7	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034384	plate_81FE7ABXX_7	SRS417490	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).   See Bentley et al (2008) for details of the sequencing process and chemistry.	library_81FENABXX_7	OTHER	GENOMIC	Restriction Digest	SINGLE - 	NA	NA	READ_INDEX: 0; READ_CLASS: Application Read; READ_TYPE: Forward; BASE_COORD: 1	ILLUMINA	Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	INSTRUMENT_MODEL: Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	NA	1034398	plate_81FENABXX_7	SRS417504	4577	NA	NA	NA	This sample is a Genotyping-by-sequencing library with pooled individuals as described in http://www.maizegenetics.net/Table/Genotyping-By-Sequencing/.

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).

Adapters were then quantified using an intercalating dye (picogreen; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA), diluted in water to 0.6 ng/microL, and 6 microL (3.6 ng) of each pair of adapters (barcode and common) was aliquoted into a 96-well PCR plate and dried down. DNA samples (100ng in a volume of 10 microL) were added to individual adapter-containing wells and plates were, again, dried.    Samples (DNA plus adapters) were digested for 2 h at 75C with the restriction enzyme specified in the sample description. Adapters were then ligated to sticky ends by adding 30 microL of a solution containing ligase buffer with ATP (1.66 X) and T4 ligase (640 cohesive end units) (New England Biolabs) to each well.  Samples were incubated at 22C for 1 h and heated to 65C for 30 min to inactivate theT4 ligase.  Sets of 48 or 96 digested DNA samples, each with a different barcode adapter,  were combined (5 microL each) and purified using a commercial kit (QIAquick PCR Purification Kit, Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA samples were eluted in a final volume of 50 microL.   Restriction fragments from each library were then amplified in 50 microL volumes containing 2 microL pooled DNA fragments, 1X Taq Master Mix (New England Biolabs) and 25 pmol, each, of the following primers: (A) 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT and (B) 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGATCGGTCTCGGCATTCCTGCTGAACCGCTCTTCCGATCT.   These primers contained complementary sequences both for amplifying restriction fragments with ligated adapters, and for facilitating downstream sequencing (i.e., binding PCR products to oligonucleotides that coat the Illumina sequencing flow cell and priming DNA sequencing reactions).     Temperature cycling consisted of 72C for 5 min, 98C for 30 s followed by 18 cycles of 98?C for 30 s, 65C for 30 s, 72C for 30 s with a final Taq extension step at 72C for 5 min.   These amplified sample pools constitute a sequencing library. Libraries were purified as above (except that the final elution volume is 30 microL) and 1 microL was loaded onto an Experion automated electrophoresis station (BioRad) for evaluation of fragment sizes.   Libraries were considered suitable for sequencing if adapter dimers (~128 bp in length) were minimal or absent and the majority of other DNA fragments were between 170-350 bp. If adapter dimers were present in excess of 0.5% based on the Experion output, libraries were constructed again using a few DNA samples and decreasing adapter amounts.  Once the appropriate quantity of adapters was empirically determined for a particular enzyme/species combination, no further adapter titration was necessary.  Single-end sequencing (86 bp reads), one 48- or 96-plex library per flowcell channel, was performed on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina, Inc.).

varieties important to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other semi-arid tropical regions of the world. Using next generation sequencing technologies combined with high levels of multiplexing and very inexpensive sample preparation methods, we will establish a platform to provide 100,000 - 1 million markers per sample for a cost substantially below current field trials costs. This integrated platform will produce robust protocols for the entire pipeline from DNA preparation to bioinformatic analyses that are essential for genomic selection algorithms. Algorithms and software will be developed to determine allelism and genotypes without the need for reference genome sequence. Moreover, these approaches will be generalized so in the future any large number of individuals of any species can be genotyped with equal ease.

varieties important to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other semi-arid tropical regions of the world. Using next generation sequencing technologies combined with high levels of multiplexing and very inexpensive sample preparation methods, we will establish a platform to provide 100,000 - 1 million markers per sample for a cost substantially below current field trials costs. This integrated platform will produce robust protocols for the entire pipeline from DNA preparation to bioinformatic analyses that are essential for genomic selection algorithms. Algorithms and software will be developed to determine allelism and genotypes without the need for reference genome sequence. Moreover, these approaches will be generalized so in the future any large number of individuals of any species can be genotyped with equal ease.

varieties important to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other semi-arid tropical regions of the world. Using next generation sequencing technologies combined with high levels of multiplexing and very inexpensive sample preparation methods, we will establish a platform to provide 100,000 - 1 million markers per sample for a cost substantially below current field trials costs. This integrated platform will produce robust protocols for the entire pipeline from DNA preparation to bioinformatic analyses that are essential for genomic selection algorithms. Algorithms and software will be developed to determine allelism and genotypes without the need for reference genome sequence. Moreover, these approaches will be generalized so in the future any large number of individuals of any species can be genotyped with equal ease.

varieties important to smallholder farmers in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) and other semi-arid tropical regions of the world. Using next generation sequencing technologies combined with high levels of multiplexing and very inexpensive sample preparation methods, we will establish a platform to provide 100,000 - 1 million markers per sample for a cost substantially below current field trials costs. This integrated platform will produce robust protocols for the entire pipeline from DNA preparation to bioinformatic analyses that are essential for genomic selection algorithms. Algorithms and software will be developed to determine allelism and genotypes without the need for reference genome sequence. Moreover, these approaches will be generalized so in the future any large number of individuals of any species can be genotyped with equal ease.

Anti-GFP (ab290, Abcam) and anti-HA (H3663, Sigma) antibodies were used for immunoprecipitation of RA1-YFP and RA1-HA, respectively, and protein A agarose/salmon sperm DNA beads (16-157, Millipore) were used to precipitate antibody complexes. ChIP-seq library preparation were performed as previously described (Bolduc et al. 2012; Morohashi et al. 2012).  ChIP DNA was subjected to end repair and A-base addition, followed by ligation with Illumina adapters made by annealing Mltplx_short and Mltplx_long oligos.  Library amplification was performed by PCR using Phusion Hot Start II High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (F549L, Thermo Scientific) with MltplxPCR1.0 and PCR2.0_indx1 to 7, followed by gel-size fractionation to obtain 200-500bp fragments.

To identify targets of RA1 and to distinguish direct vs. indirect interactions, we performed Chromatin Immunoprecipitation (ChIP)-seq and compared the results to gene expression data (RNA-seq datasets for Eveland et al., 2013, submitted).  We mapped genome-wide occupancy of RA1 and showed that it differently regulates modules of target genes based on spatiotemporal context.

After incubation, beads were washed 5 times in the following buffers: (1) Low Salt Wash Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 150 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), (2) High Salt Wash Buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 2 mM EDTA, 500 mM NaCl, 0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100), (3) LiCl Buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA, 250 mM LiCl, 1% NP-40, 1% sodium deoxycholate), and (4) TE Buffer, twice (10 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA). Chromatin was eluted from beads with 200 ÃŽÂ¼l Elution Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 10 mM EDTA, 200 mM NaCl, 1% SDS), treated with RNase for 2h at 37Ã‚Â°C, deproteinized with Proteinase K for 2h at 45Ã‚Â°C, and decrosslinked at 65Ã‚Â°C for 8 h. DNA was purified using MinElute PCR Purification Columns (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). DNA concentration was quantified using Quant-IT dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen).

Overall design: To identify sites occupied by RAD51, we compared the genomic distribution of RAD51 ChIP-seq reads to (i) Illumina-sequenced meiotic input chromatin that was not subjected to ChIP, (ii) ChIP products generated by using pre-immune IgG, instead of the anti-RAD51 antibody, on meiotic chromatin, and (iii) ChIP products generated using the anti-RAD51 antibody on leaf tissue chromatin. RAD51 ChIP-seq was also performed on the meiotic chromatin of a POOR HOMOLOGOUS SYNAPSIS1 (phs1) mutant.

We obtained all the B73-related inbreds stocks as well as one of our B73 stocks (B73 Ã¢â‚¬Å“distant kinÃ¢â‚¬Â in Table 2) from GRIN National Genetic Resources Program (http://www.ars-grin.gov). The other B73 samples (B73 Ã¢â‚¬Å“referenceÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“selfed siblingsÃ¢â‚¬Â in Table 2) were from a B73 lineage that had been separated from the GRIN B73 for at least eight generations.  We carried out native ChIP on these samples using anti-CENH3 (maize) antibodies [Nagaki et al (2003), Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that the 180-bp satellite repeat is the key functional DNA element of Arabidopsis thaliana centromeres, Genetics; and Zhong et al (2002) Centromeric retroelements and satellites interact with maize kinetochore protein CENH3, Plant Cell]. Briefly, we extracted chromatin from finely ground, frozen tissue, digested with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to reduce the chromatin to mainly mononucleosomes, before immunoprecipitating to select for CENH3 nucleosomes. We used Protein A sepharose to purify the antibody/nucleosome/DNA complexes. Immediately after pre-cleaning and before incubating with antibodies, a portion of the B73 reference sample was removed and set aside as the input sample (B73 reference input).    For all samples, we started with 100-300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA and end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L), A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S), ligated to adapters (8.3 nM) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S, and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation at 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; no more than 12 cycles of 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72Ã‚Â°C for 5 minutes. We purified DNA between each enzymatic treatment using Agencourt AMPure XP at a ratio of 1.8:1, except after PCR, where the ratio was 0.9:1. Prior to sequencing, we selected amplicons corresponding to ~150-bp inserts by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704). We used indexed PCR primers from the ScriptSeq Index PCR primers (Epicentre, #RSBC10948 and #SSIP1202) at a concentration of 200 nM. We used a Y adapter of the following two oligos at a concentration of 8.3 nM each: /5Phos/GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT and ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT.

We transferred all aliquots simultaneously to a 37Ã‚Â°C water bath and removed one at a time at the following time points: 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min, and 16 min (at which time the bulk of DNA had been digested to fragments of less than 200 bp in length). To stop the digestions, we immediately placed the samples on ice and added 150 ÃŽÂ¼l of Histone Removal Buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and 15 ÃŽÂ¼l of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, #P8102S). We incubated the samples for 45 minutes at 65Ã‚Â°C to digest histones, then further purified the DNA by adding an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and centrifuging. We then added an equal volume (300 ÃŽÂ¼l) of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the supernatant and centrifuged again. We collected the second supernatant (240 ÃŽÂ¼l) and precipitated the DNA at -20Ã‚Â°C after adding 1 ÃŽÂ¼l 20 mg/ml glycogen, 10 uL 5 M NaCl and 625 ÃŽÂ¼l ethanol. We pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, let it dry, and suspended in 100 ÃŽÂ¼l 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Finally, we size selected for ~150-bp fragments by gel electrophoresis (3.5% agarose), and extracted the DNA with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and recovered ~100 ng of DNA. We selected the 1, 4, and 8-minute digestions for Illumina library preparation (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“mildÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“intermediateÃ¢â‚¬Â, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“severeÃ¢â‚¬Â digestions).

Thermocycler conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation at 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; no more than 12 cycles of 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72Ã‚Â°C for 5 minutes. We purified DNA between each enzymatic treatment using Agencourt AMPure XP at a ratio of 1.8:1, except after PCR, where the ratio was 0.9:1. Prior to sequencing, we selected amplicons corresponding to ~150 bp inserts by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704). We used indexed PCR primers from the ScriptSeq Index PCR primers (Epicentre, #RSBC10948 and #SSIP1202) at a concentration of 200 nM.

We transferred all aliquots simultaneously to a 37Ã‚Â°C water bath and removed one at a time at the following time points: 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min, and 16 min (at which time the bulk of DNA had been digested to fragments of less than 200 bp in length). To stop the digestions, we immediately placed the samples on ice and added 150 ÃŽÂ¼l of Histone Removal Buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and 15 ÃŽÂ¼l of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, #P8102S). We incubated the samples for 45 minutes at 65Ã‚Â°C to digest histones, then further purified the DNA by adding an equal volume of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and centrifuging. We then added an equal volume (300 ÃŽÂ¼l) of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) to the supernatant and centrifuged again. We collected the second supernatant (240 ÃŽÂ¼l) and precipitated the DNA at -20Ã‚Â°C after adding 1 ÃŽÂ¼l 20 mg/ml glycogen, 10 uL 5 M NaCl and 625 ÃŽÂ¼l ethanol. We pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, let it dry, and suspended in 100 ÃŽÂ¼l 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Finally, we size selected for ~150-bp fragments by gel electrophoresis (3.5% agarose), and extracted the DNA with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen), and recovered ~100 ng of DNA. We selected the 1, 4, and 8-minute digestions for Illumina library preparation (the Ã¢â‚¬Å“mildÃ¢â‚¬Â, Ã¢â‚¬Å“intermediateÃ¢â‚¬Â, and Ã¢â‚¬Å“severeÃ¢â‚¬Â digestions).

The other B73 samples (B73 Ã¢â‚¬Å“referenceÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“selfed siblingsÃ¢â‚¬Â in Table 2) were from a B73 lineage that had been separated from the GRIN B73 for at least eight generations.  We carried out native ChIP on these samples using anti-CENH3 (maize) antibodies [Nagaki et al (2003), Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that the 180-bp satellite repeat is the key functional DNA element of Arabidopsis thaliana centromeres, Genetics; and Zhong et al (2002) Centromeric retroelements and satellites interact with maize kinetochore protein CENH3, Plant Cell]. Briefly, we extracted chromatin from finely ground, frozen tissue, digested with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to reduce the chromatin to mainly mononucleosomes, before immunoprecipitating to select for CENH3 nucleosomes. We used Protein A sepharose to purify the antibody/nucleosome/DNA complexes. Immediately after pre-cleaning and before incubating with antibodies, a portion of the B73 reference sample was removed and set aside as the input sample (B73 reference input).    For all samples, we started with 100-300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA and end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L), A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S), ligated to adapters (8.3 nM) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S, and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation at 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; no more than 12 cycles of 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72Ã‚Â°C for 5 minutes. We purified DNA between each enzymatic treatment using Agencourt AMPure XP at a ratio of 1.8:1, except after PCR, where the ratio was 0.9:1. Prior to sequencing, we selected amplicons corresponding to ~150 bp inserts by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704). We used indexed PCR primers from the ScriptSeq Index PCR primers (Epicentre, #RSBC10948 and #SSIP1202) at a concentration of 200 nM. We used a Y adapter of the following two oligos at a concentration of 8.3 nM each: /5Phos/GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT and ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT.

We carried out native ChIP on these samples using anti-CENH3 (maize) antibodies [Nagaki et al (2003), Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that the 180-bp satellite repeat is the key functional DNA element of Arabidopsis thaliana centromeres, Genetics; and Zhong et al (2002) Centromeric retroelements and satellites interact with maize kinetochore protein CENH3, Plant Cell]. Briefly, we extracted chromatin from finely ground, frozen tissue, digested with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to reduce the chromatin to mainly mononucleosomes, before immunoprecipitating to select for CENH3 nucleosomes. We used Protein A sepharose to purify the antibody/nucleosome/DNA complexes. Immediately after pre-cleaning and before incubating with antibodies, a portion of the B73 reference sample was removed and set aside as the input sample (B73 reference input).    For all samples, we started with 100-300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA and end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L), A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S), ligated to adapters (8.3 nM) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S, and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation at 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; no more than 12 cycles of 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72Ã‚Â°C for 5 minutes. We purified DNA between each enzymatic treatment using Agencourt AMPure XP at a ratio of 1.8:1, except after PCR, where the ratio was 0.9:1. Prior to sequencing, we selected amplicons corresponding to ~150-bp inserts by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704). We used indexed PCR primers from the ScriptSeq Index PCR primers (Epicentre, #RSBC10948 and #SSIP1202) at a concentration of 200 nM. We used a Y adapter of the following two oligos at a concentration of 8.3 nM each: /5Phos/GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT and ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT.

We obtained all the B73-related inbreds stocks as well as one of our B73 stocks (B73 Ã¢â‚¬Å“distant kinÃ¢â‚¬Â in Table 2) from GRIN National Genetic Resources Program (http://www.ars-grin.gov). The other B73 samples (B73 Ã¢â‚¬Å“referenceÃ¢â‚¬Â and Ã¢â‚¬Å“selfed siblingsÃ¢â‚¬Â in Table 2) were from a B73 lineage that had been separated from the GRIN B73 for at least eight generations.  We carried out native ChIP on these samples using anti-CENH3 (maize) antibodies [Nagaki et al (2003), Chromatin immunoprecipitation reveals that the 180-bp satellite repeat is the key functional DNA element of Arabidopsis thaliana centromeres, Genetics; and Zhong et al (2002) Centromeric retroelements and satellites interact with maize kinetochore protein CENH3, Plant Cell]. Briefly, we extracted chromatin from finely ground, frozen tissue, digested with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) to reduce the chromatin to mainly mononucleosomes, before immunoprecipitating to select for CENH3 nucleosomes. We used Protein A sepharose to purify the antibody/nucleosome/DNA complexes. Immediately after pre-cleaning and before incubating with antibodies, a portion of the B73 reference sample was removed and set aside as the input sample (B73 reference input).    For all samples, we started with 100-300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA and end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L), A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S), ligated to adapters (8.3 nM) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S, and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation at 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; no more than 12 cycles of 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72Ã‚Â°C for 5 minutes. We purified DNA between each enzymatic treatment using Agencourt AMPure XP at a ratio of 1.8:1, except after PCR, where the ratio was 0.9:1. Prior to sequencing, we selected amplicons corresponding to ~150-bp inserts by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704). We used indexed PCR primers from the ScriptSeq Index PCR primers (Epicentre, #RSBC10948 and #SSIP1202) at a concentration of 200 nM. We used a Y adapter of the following two oligos at a concentration of 8.3 nM each: /5Phos/GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT and ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT.

Prior to sequencing, we selected amplicons corresponding to ~150 bp inserts by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel and purified using a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704). We used indexed PCR primers from the ScriptSeq Index PCR primers (Epicentre, #RSBC10948 and #SSIP1202) at a concentration of 200 nM. We used a Y adapter of the following two oligos at a concentration of 8.3 nM each: /5Phos/GATCGGAAGAGCACACGTCT and ACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT.

The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifuging at 6000 X G for 10 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C, washed by suspending them in Nuclei Isolation Buffer (without TWEEN 40) after pouring off the supernatant, then pelleted by centrifuging at 6000 X G for 5 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C. Approximately 200 ÃŽÂ¼l of nuclei were recovered. The purified nuclei were treated with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase; New England BioLabs, #M0247S) by adding 2 ÃŽÂ¼l MNase and 800 ÃŽÂ¼l Micrococcal nuclease buffer (1X), for a final MNase concentration of ~4 gel units/ÃŽÂ¼l. This mixture was divided into six 150-ÃŽÂ¼l aliquots while still on ice. All aliquots were transferred simultaneously to a 37Ã‚Â°C water bath and removed one at a time at the following time points: 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min, and 16 min (at which time nearly all the chromatin had been reduced to mononucleosomes; Figure 2A).

The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, air dried, and suspended in 100 ÃŽÂ¼l 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Finally, fragments of ~150-bp in length were selected by gel electrophoresis (3.5% agarose), and the DNA extracted with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704) without heating. Approximately 100 ng of DNA was recovered. The 1, 4, and 16-minute digestions were selected for Illumina library preparation. ~300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA was end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L); A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S); ligated to adapters (8.3 nM concentration) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S); and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer.

Crosslinked, isolated nuclei were sonicated using the Branson Double Step Microtip (Digital Sonifier #101-148-063) at an amplitude of 10% in 1.5 ml eppendorf tubes. The samples were sonicated for 5 seconds, followed by 20 seconds on ice, and this was repeated 45 times. Instead of protein A-Agarose beads, DiaMag Protein A-coated magnetic beads were used (Diagenode # kch-802-150). Immediately before use, the required amount of beads were washed two times in ChIP Ab Incubation buffer (100 ul/30 ul beads) and resuspended in the original volume. Instead of spinning, a magnetic separation rack (DYNAL # MPC-S) was used. No salmon sperm DNA was added to the immunoprecipitation reaction. Instead a same volume of ChIP Ab Incubation buffer was used. A 1:100 dilution of antibodies recognizing H3K9me2 (Cell Signaling # 4658) and H3K27me2 (Cell Signaling # 9728) were used in the ChIP reactions. The quality of the precipitated material was checked by qPCR as described previously (Haring et al., 2010). ~300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA was end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L); A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S); ligated to adapters (8.3 nM concentration) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S); and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer.

The nuclei were then pelleted by centrifuging at 6000 X G for 10 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C, washed by suspending them in Nuclei Isolation Buffer (without TWEEN 40) after pouring off the supernatant, then pelleted by centrifuging at 6000 X G for 5 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C. Approximately 200 ÃŽÂ¼l of nuclei were recovered. The purified nuclei were treated with Micrococcal nuclease (MNase; New England BioLabs, #M0247S) by adding 2 ÃŽÂ¼l MNase and 800 ÃŽÂ¼l Micrococcal nuclease buffer (1X), for a final MNase concentration of ~4 gel units/ÃŽÂ¼l. This mixture was divided into six 150-ÃŽÂ¼l aliquots while still on ice. All aliquots were transferred simultaneously to a 37Ã‚Â°C water bath and removed one at a time at the following time points: 30 s, 1 min, 2 min, 4 min, 6 min, 8 min, and 16 min (at which time nearly all the chromatin had been reduced to mononucleosomes; Figure 2A). To stop the digestions, the samples were immediately placed on ice and 150 ÃŽÂ¼l of Histone Removal Buffer (1% SDS, 100 mM NaCl, 50 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8) and 15 ÃŽÂ¼l of 20 mg/ml Proteinase K (New England Biolabs, #P8102S) was added to each one. Samples were incubated for 45 minutes at 65Ã‚Â°C to digest histones, then the DNA purified by adding an equal volume (315 ÃŽÂ¼l) of phenol:chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (25:24:1) and centrifuging. An equal volume (300 ÃŽÂ¼l) of chloroform:isoamyl alcohol (24:1) was added to the supernatant and the samples were centrifuged again. The second supernatant was collected (240 ÃŽÂ¼l) and the DNA precipitated at -20Ã‚Â°C after adding 1 ÃŽÂ¼l 20 mg/ml glycogen, 10 ul 5 M NaCl and 625 ÃŽÂ¼l ethanol. The DNA was pelleted by centrifugation, washed with 75% ethanol, air dried, and suspended in 100 ÃŽÂ¼l 10 mM Tris pH 7.5. Finally, fragments of ~150-bp in length were selected by gel electrophoresis (3.5% agarose), and the DNA extracted with a QIAquick gel extraction kit (Qiagen #28704) without heating. Approximately 100 ng of DNA was recovered. The 1, 4, and 16-minute digestions were selected for Illumina library preparation. ~300 ng of double-stranded, fragmented DNA was end-repaired and 5'-phosphorylated using the End Repair Module (New England Biolabs #E6050L); A-tailed with Klenow exo- (New England Biolabs #M0212S); ligated to adapters (8.3 nM concentration) with a Quick Ligase Kit (New England Biolabs, #M2200S); and PCR amplified using Phusion 2X HF master mix (New England Biolabs #M0531S) in a 50-ul total volume containing 200 nM of each primer. Thermocycler conditions were as follows: An initial denaturation at 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; 10 cycles of 98Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, 65Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds, and 72Ã‚Â°C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72Ã‚Â°C for 5 minutes. DNA was purified between each enzymatic treatments using Agencourt AMPure XP at a ratio of 1.8:1 except after PCR, where the ratio was 0.9:1. Prior to sequencing, amplicons of ~150 bp in length were selected by gel electrophoresis on a 2.5% agarose gel.

Resequencing is being performed in a public panel of diverse maize inbred lines that enables high-resolution mapping. The target regions have been identified in linkage and association mapping studies as being associated with quantitative resistance to grey leaf spot, northern leaf blight, and/or southern leaf blight diseases of maize.

A collection of mutant alleles for 11 maize genes predicted to play roles in controlling DNA methylation were isolated through forward- or reverse-genetics approaches. Low-coverage whole genome bisulfite sequencing and high-coverage sequence-capture bisulfite sequencing were applied to mutant lines to determine context- and locus-specific effects of these mutations on DNA methylation profiles. Plants containing mutant alleles for components of the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway exhibit loss of CHH methylation at many loci as well as CG and CHG methylation at a small number of loci. Those loci tend to have elevated CHH levels in wild-type plants relative to the average of genome-wide value, and are enriched for 21-nt to 24-nt small RNAs. Plants containing loss-of-function alleles for chromomethylase (CMT) genes exhibit strong genome-wide reductions in CHG methylation and some locus-specific loss of CHH methylation. There is evidence for two pathways mediating CHH methylation in maize with the RdDM pathway influencing CHH levels in regions near genes and in short length transposons, while an ortholog of the Arabidopsis CMT3 mediated pathway plays a role in CHH methylation present in long transposons, similar to the role played by CMT2 in Arabidopsis. In an attempt to identify stocks with stronger reductions in DNA methylation levels than provided by single gene mutations, we performed crosses to create double mutants for the maize CMT3 orthologs, Zmet2 and Zmet5, and for the maize DDM1 orthologs, Chr101 and Chr106. While loss-of-function alleles are viable as single gene mutants, the double mutants were not recovered, suggesting that severe perturbations of the maize methylome may have stronger deleterious phenotypic effects than in Arabidopsis.

While loss-of-function alleles are viable as single gene mutants, the double mutants were not recovered, suggesting that severe perturbations of the maize methylome may have stronger deleterious phenotypic effects than in Arabidopsis.

While loss-of-function alleles are viable as single gene mutants, the double mutants were not recovered, suggesting that severe perturbations of the maize methylome may have stronger deleterious phenotypic effects than in Arabidopsis.

These data were compared to transcript levels of associated genes. Our data revealed that for individual genes fold-changes in histone modification and transcript abundance were much better correlated than absolute intensities. When focusing on regulated modification sites, we identified secondary upstream H3 lysine 9 acetylation peaks (SUPs) on upstream promoter regions of approximately 6% of all acetylated genes. SUPs showed stronger regulation than the previously described acetylation peaks at transcription initiation sites, were more often found on genes that were upregulated towards the maturing zone than on downregulated genes, and were significantly enriched on photosynthetic genes. We identified SUPs on all genes encoding enzymes of the C4 cycle. Moreover, SUPs were enriched in four lists of candidate C4-associated genes that were derived from previous transcriptomic studies. Based on these data, we used highly regulated SUPs as an epigenetic mark to identify new genes potentially involved in C4 metabolism. This approach also allowed the identification of ethylene response elements as highly enriched cis-acting elements in SUP regions. Our data suggest co-evolution of epigenetic promoter elements during the establishment of C4 photosynthesis. Overall design: Comparative analysis of H3K9ac, H3K4me3 and the transcription between two developmental zones within one maize leaf.

These data were compared to transcript levels of associated genes. Our data revealed that for individual genes fold-changes in histone modification and transcript abundance were much better correlated than absolute intensities. When focusing on regulated modification sites, we identified secondary upstream H3 lysine 9 acetylation peaks (SUPs) on upstream promoter regions of approximately 6% of all acetylated genes. SUPs showed stronger regulation than the previously described acetylation peaks at transcription initiation sites, were more often found on genes that were upregulated towards the maturing zone than on downregulated genes, and were significantly enriched on photosynthetic genes. We identified SUPs on all genes encoding enzymes of the C4 cycle. Moreover, SUPs were enriched in four lists of candidate C4-associated genes that were derived from previous transcriptomic studies. Based on these data, we used highly regulated SUPs as an epigenetic mark to identify new genes potentially involved in C4 metabolism. This approach also allowed the identification of ethylene response elements as highly enriched cis-acting elements in SUP regions. Our data suggest co-evolution of epigenetic promoter elements during the establishment of C4 photosynthesis.

ZmCCA1b is characterized as a central clock regulator gene with evolutionarily conserved molecular and circadian functions and nonadditively expressed in F1 hybrid seedlings. ZmCCA1b binds to over 4,300 target genes in the maize genomes, of which annotation confirms energy metabolic pathways as the main output. We report that an altered temporal binding activity of ZmCCA1b in the hybrid seedlings, which increases expression of carbon fixation genes, increases carbon fixation rates and biomass, demonstrating a novel example of how circadian-regulatory networks directly contribute to growth vigor in maize hybrids. These results collectively offer new insights into clock-mediated regulation of growth vigor in hybrid plants and crops. Overall design: Profiling genome-wide binding events of ZmCCA1b in the maize inbreds and F1 hybrids at ZT3, ZT9 and ZT15 using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). 2 biological replicates for each sample were used. Input DNA sample corresponding to each ChIP sample was also sequenced in parallel. We have developed a native antibody for the protein (GRMZM2G014902; epitope: residues 11-77) for the ChIP-seq study.

We report that an altered temporal binding activity of ZmCCA1b in the hybrid seedlings, which increases expression of carbon fixation genes, increases carbon fixation rates and biomass, demonstrating a novel example of how circadian-regulatory networks directly contribute to growth vigor in maize hybrids. These results collectively offer new insights into clock-mediated regulation of growth vigor in hybrid plants and crops. Overall design: Profiling genome-wide binding events of ZmCCA1b in the maize inbreds and F1 hybrids at ZT3, ZT9 and ZT15 using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing (ChIP-seq). 2 biological replicates for each sample were used. Input DNA sample corresponding to each ChIP sample was also sequenced in parallel. We have developed a native antibody for the protein (GRMZM2G014902; epitope: residues 11-77) for the ChIP-seq study.

The examination of maize genes and conserved non-coding sequences reveals that many of these are flanked by regions of elevated asymmetric CHH (where H is any base except G) methylation. These mCHH islands are quite short (~100bp) and are enriched near active genes. The analysis of DNA methylation in other sequence contexts and several chromatin modifications reveal that the mCHH island marks the transition from heterochromatin associated modifications to euchromatin associated modifications. The mCHH island often occurs at the edge of the transposon that is located nearest to the gene. The presence of a mCHH island is fairly consistent in several distinct tissues that were surveyed but shows some variation among different haplotypes. The presence of InDels in promoters often influences the presence and position of the mCHH island. The mCHH islands are dependent upon RNA-directed DNA methylation activities. The mCHH islands are lost in the mop1 and mop3 mutants but the nearby genes do not necessarily exhibit altered expression levels. Instead, the loss of the mCHH island often results in the erosion of heterochromatic marks into the nearby transposon. This suggests that mCHH islands and RNA-directed DNA methylation near maize genes may act to preserve the silencing of transposons from activity of the genes.

In 50 mL centrifuge tubes, 35 mL nuclear suspensions were underplayed with 15 mL of Percoll cushion composed of 50% Percoll (GE) in BFA. Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged at 3000g for 15 min at 4Ã‚Â°C.

Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C, and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 2.5 mL MDB. Nuclei were aliquoted into 500 mL aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80Ã‚Â°C until use. Nuclei were thawed at room temperature, digested by adding MNase to 10U/mL (light) or 100 U/mL (heavy), and incubating at room temperature for 5 minutes. Digestions were stopped with 10 mM EGTA. Nuclei were de-cross-linked by incubating overnight at 65Ã‚Â°C in the presence of 10% SDS and 100 ug/mL Proteinase K. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by EtOH precipitation. Digested DNA was resuspended in 40 ug/mL RNase A and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel. DNA fragments under 200 bp were excised and gel extracted following ethidium bromide staining with the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions. Following nucleus isolation and digestion, gel-extracted DNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries using the NEBNextÃ‚Â® Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) using manufacturer instructions. Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on 8 Illumina HiSeq 2500 lanes with paired-end 50-cycle sequencing.

The suspension was filtered through one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. In 50 mL centrifuge tubes, 35 mL nuclear suspensions were underplayed with 15 mL of Percoll cushion composed of 50% Percoll (GE) in BFA. Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged at 3000g for 15 min at 4Ã‚Â°C. The nuclei at the Percoll interface were transferred to a 50 mL tube and diluted two-fold with MNase digestion buffer (Ã¢â‚¬Å“MDBÃ¢â‚¬Â, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 320 mM sucrose, 4 mM MgCl2, and 1mM CaCl2). Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C, and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 2.5 mL MDB. Nuclei were aliquoted into 500 mL aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80Ã‚Â°C until use. Nuclei were thawed at room temperature, digested by adding MNase to 10U/mL (light) or 100 U/mL (heavy), and incubating at room temperature for 5 minutes. Digestions were stopped with 10 mM EGTA. Nuclei were de-cross-linked by incubating overnight at 65Ã‚Â°C in the presence of 10% SDS and 100 ug/mL Proteinase K. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by EtOH precipitation. Digested DNA was resuspended in 40 ug/mL RNase A and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel. DNA fragments under 200 bp were excised and gel extracted following ethidium bromide staining with the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions. Following nucleus isolation and digestion, gel-extracted DNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries using the NEBNextÃ‚Â® Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) using manufacturer instructions. Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on 8 Illumina HiSeq 2500 lanes with paired-end 50-cycle sequencing.

Fixation was stopped by adding glycine to 125 mM. Nuclei were isolated by adding Triton X-100 to 1% and stirring for 10 minutes. The suspension was filtered through one layer of Miracloth (Calbiochem) and placed in 50 mL centrifuge tubes. In 50 mL centrifuge tubes, 35 mL nuclear suspensions were underplayed with 15 mL of Percoll cushion composed of 50% Percoll (GE) in BFA. Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged at 3000g for 15 min at 4Ã‚Â°C. The nuclei at the Percoll interface were transferred to a 50 mL tube and diluted two-fold with MNase digestion buffer (Ã¢â‚¬Å“MDBÃ¢â‚¬Â, containing 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5, 320 mM sucrose, 4 mM MgCl2, and 1mM CaCl2). Nuclei suspensions were centrifuged at 2000g for 10 minutes at 4Ã‚Â°C, and nuclei pellets were resuspended in 2.5 mL MDB. Nuclei were aliquoted into 500 mL aliquots, flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80Ã‚Â°C until use. Nuclei were thawed at room temperature, digested by adding MNase to 10U/mL (light) or 100 U/mL (heavy), and incubating at room temperature for 5 minutes. Digestions were stopped with 10 mM EGTA. Nuclei were de-cross-linked by incubating overnight at 65Ã‚Â°C in the presence of 10% SDS and 100 ug/mL Proteinase K. DNA was extracted by phenol-chloroform extraction followed by EtOH precipitation. Digested DNA was resuspended in 40 ug/mL RNase A and electrophoresed in a 1% agarose gel. DNA fragments under 200 bp were excised and gel extracted following ethidium bromide staining with the Qiaex II gel extraction kit (Qiagen) following the manufacturerÃ¢â‚¬â„¢s instructions. Following nucleus isolation and digestion, gel-extracted DNA was used to prepare sequencing libraries using the NEBNextÃ‚Â® Ultra DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) using manufacturer instructions. Indexed libraries were pooled and sequenced on 8 Illumina HiSeq 2500 lanes with paired-end 50-cycle sequencing.

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.

In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

Although a food staple in many regions of the world, most is used for animal feed and ethanol fuel. Maize was domesticated from wild teosinte in Central America and its cultivation spread throughout the Americas by Pre-Columbian civilizations. In addition to its economic value, maize is an important model organism for studies in plant genetics, physiology, and development. It has a large genome of of about 2.4 gigabases with a haploid chromosome number of 10 (Schnable et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2009). Maize is distinguished from other grasses in that its genome arose from an ancient tetraploidy event unique to its lineage.  The maize B73 reference genome has been revised three times since its initial release as a BAC-by-BAC assembly in 2009 (Schnable et al., 2009). This entirely new assembly of the maize genome (B73 RefGen_v4) is constructed from PacBio Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing at approximately 60-fold coverage and scaffolded with the aid of a high-resolution whole-genome restriction (optical) mapping. The pseudomolecules of maize B73 RefGen_v4 are assembled nearly end-to-end, representing a 52-fold improvement in average contig size relative to the previous reference (B73 RefGen_v3).

BAC DNA was isolated using the QIAGEN Large-Construct Kit (QIAGEN Sciences, Inc., Germantown, Maryland, USA). For Illumina library preparation 5 Ã‚Âµg of BAC DNA was fragmented using NEBNext dsDNA Fragmentase enzyme (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA) to obtain fragments with maximum size of 300-400 bp. Fragments in the 200-300 bp size range were gel purified using QIAGEN Gel purification kit followed by end-repair of DNA using NEBNext End Repair Module and dA-tailing using NEBNext dA-Tailing. DNA clean up following end-repair and dA-tailing was done using Agencourt AMPure XP reagent (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, California, USA). To each BAC, equimolar stocks of a universal adapter and unique index adapter was ligated using Enzymatics ligase (Enzymatics, Inc., Beverly, Massachusetts, USA) following standard protocols and then the reaction was treated with proteinase K. The ligation reaction was run on an agarose gel and fragments sized 400-500 bp were purified using QIAGEN Gel purification kit. A single cycle of PCR was run with Illumina forward and reverse primers and PCR cleanup was done using AMPure beads. The library quantification was done using qPCR standards from Kapa Biosystems (Wilmington, Massachusetts, USA) and integrity of samples was determined using Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Inc., Santa Clara, California, USA). Illumina MiSeq sequencing (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, California, USA) was done at the Evolutionary Genetics Core Facility at the HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi Institute of Marine Biology (Kaneohe, HawaiÃ¢â‚¬Ëœi, USA)."

To assess the performance of this approach, we got empirical results from the model species Oryza sativa L. spp. japonica and a near-model species Zea mays L. We also explore repeatability by testing the effectiveness of the method in Phyllostachys heterocycla and Alloteropsis semialata (R. Br.) Hitchc. Finally, we were able to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships of two woody bamboos genera, Dendrocalamus and Phyllostachys with this modified ddRAD (MiddRAD) Protocol.

The terminal 0-1 mm or 1-3 mm root segments were excised, fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 15 minutes, washed in PBS, and snap frozen. Nuclei were isolated from the frozen, excised roots, the incorporated EdU was "clicked" to Alexa Fluor-488 (AF-488), and total DNA was stained with DAPI. Nuclei were flow sorted based on EdU incorporation (AF-488 fluorescence) and DNA content (DAPI fluorescence) into early, mid and late stages of either the mitotic S phase (0-1 mm) or the endocycle S phase (1-3 mm). G1 nuclei were also sorted to use as a genomic DNA reference for sequencing.

The ability of transcription factors (TF) to bind cis-elements is often associated with accessible chromatin regions. Therefore, identification of these accessible regions throughout plant genomes is important to understanding the relationship between TF binding, chromatin status and the regulation of gene expression. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a recently developed technique used to map open chromatin zones in animal genomes. However, in plants, the existence of cell walls, subcellular organelles and the lack of stable cell lines have prevented routine application of this technique. Here, we describe an assay combining ATAC-seq with Fluorescence-Activated Nuclei Sorting (FANS) to identify and map open chromatin and TF-binding sites in plant genomes. FANS-ATAC-seq compares favorably with published DNaseI sequencing (DNase-seq) results and it only requires 500-50,000 nuclei for accurate identification of open chromatin states. Overall design: Chromatin accessibility profiling (FANS-ATAC-seq) data collected from Arabidopsis 7-day old Col-0 whole seedlings, roots, 35S:H2AX-GFP/Col-0 whole seedlings, or 10-day old maize B73 overground parts. Replicates are included when available. Please note that the *1million_reads raw data were used to generate the percentage of nuclear and organelle reads data, which is included in the associated manuscript as supplementary data table (therefore not included in the GEO records).

In this work, we have integrated genome-wide low DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and H3K9ac data from two tissues, inner stem tissue (V2-IST) from seedlings at the V2 stage and husk tissue, in the crop plant Zea mays.  This study identified approximately 1,400 candidate enhancers. By comparing data from two different tissues, we determined tissue-specificity of the candidate enhancers.  We also have predicted putative target genes using gene expression data taking an advantage of having data from two tissues. Overall design: Examination of H3K9ac in 2 tissue types.

This differentiation process involves tight regulation of gene expressions by regulatory sequences including transcriptional enhancers.  Enhancers can be located distantly from their target genes; this characteristic makes it difficult to identify enhancers only using experimental approaches. Importantly, enhancers carry characteristic chromatin signatures such as low DNA methylation, high chromatin accessibility and histone modifications such as H3K9ac and H3K27ac.  Computational enhancer identification approaches often use machine learning methods in combination with a number of experimental genome-wide datasets to identify key enhancers features and scans the whole genome. Limited knowledge on plant enhancers restricts us in available approaches we can use to perform genome-wide enhancer prediction in plant species.  In this work, we have integrated genome-wide low DNA methylation (Regulski et al., 2013, GSE39232), chromatin accessibility and H3K9ac data from two tissues, inner stem tissue in seedlings and husk tissue, in a crop plant Zea mays.

The inbred lines used as parents of TROPICS were chosen based on multiple publications (Nelson 2009 Ch. 4 and 5; Nelson et al. 2006; Nelson and Goodman 2008) in which tropical and semi-tropical lines were evaluated for grain yield in testcrosses with U.S.-temperate adapted lines. Among the aforementioned studies, CML10, CML258, CML277, CML341, CML373, Tzi8, and Tzi9 were top candidates as exotic germplasm for U.S. maize improvement; thus, the potential for these lines to contribute unique variation in the context of temperate maize improvement was the basis of selecting them. This population was used in a parallel selection experiment at multiple locations spanning a latitudinal gradient across the United States.References:Nelson, P. T., Jines, M., &amp; Goodman, M.
